1765--the following advertisement appeared:--</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="pagev" id="pagev">[v]</a></span>

<p>"We are also desired to give notice that there is in the Press,
and speedily will be published either by subscription or otherwise,
as the Public shall please to determine, The History of Little
Goody Two Shoes, otherwise called Margery Two Shoes. Printed and
sold at The Bible and Sun in St Paul's Churchyard, where may be had
all Mr Newbery's little books for the children and youth of these
kingdoms and the colonies. New Editions of those which were out of
print are now republished.</p>

<p>"The publication of the Lilliputian System of Politics is
postponed till the meeting of Parliament. This work, which will be
replete with cuts and characters, is not intended to exalt or
depress any particular country, to support the pride of any
particular family, or to feed the folly of any particular party,
but to <span class="newpage"><a name="pagevi" id=
"pagevi">[vi]</a></span>stimulate the mind to virtue, to promote
universal benevolence, to make mankind happy. Those who would know
more of the matter may enquire of Mr Newbery."</p>

<p>This quaint and curious announcement, with its sly humour and
serious playfulness, is characteristic of the house of John
Newbery, in the latter part of the last century; and there is no
need to speak here of the fame of the books for children which he
published; "the philanthropic publisher of St Paul's Churchyard,"
as Goldsmith calls him, conferred inestimable benefits upon
thousands of little folk, of both high and low estate. It is said
of Southey when a child that</p>

<p>"The well-known publishers of "Goody Two Shoes," "Giles
Gingerbread," and other such delectable histories, in <span class=
"newpage"><a name="pagevii" id="pagevii">[vii]</a></span>sixpenny
books for children, splendidly bound in the flowered and gilt Dutch
paper of former days, sent him twenty such volumes, and laid the
foundation of a love of books which grew with the child's growth,
and did not cease even when the vacant mind and eye could only gaze
in piteous, though blissful imbecility upon the things they
loved."[A]</p>

<p>Many of these little books have been doubtless long since
forgotten, though they did not deserve such a fate; but the name of
"Goody Two Shoes" is still familiar to the ears of English
children, though the book itself may be unknown to thousands of
little ones of this later generation.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="pageviii" id=
"pageviii">[viii]</a></span>

<p>"Goody Two Shoes" was published in April 1765, and few nursery
books have had a wider circulation, or have retained their position
so long. The number of editions that have been published both in
England and America is legion, and it has appeared in mutilated
versions under the auspices of numerous publishing houses in London
and the provinces, although of late years there have been no new
issues. Even in 1802, Charles Lamb in writing to Coleridge,
said--</p>

<p>"&nbsp;"Goody Two Shoes" is almost out of print. Mrs Barbauld's
stuff has banished all the old classics of the nursery, and the
shopman at Newbery's hardly deigned to reach them off an old
exploded corner of a shelf, when Mary asked for them. Mrs
Barbauld's and Mrs Trimmer's nonsense lay in piles about.
Knowledge, <span class="newpage"><a name="pageix" id=
"pageix">[ix]</a></span>insignificant and vapid as Mrs Barbauld's
books convey, it seems must come to a child in the shape of
knowledge; and his empty noddle must be turned with conceit of his
own powers when he has learnt that a horse is an animal, and Billy
is better than a horse, and such like, instead of that beautiful
interest in wild tales, which made the child a man, while all the
time he suspected himself to be no bigger than a child. Science has
succeeded to poetry no less in the little walks of children than
with men. Is there no possibility of averting this sore evil? Think
what you would have been now, if instead of being fed with tales
and old wives' fables in childhood, you had been crammed with
geography and natural history!</p>

<p>"Hang them!--I mean the cursed Barbauld <span class="newpage"><a
name="pagex" id="pagex">[x]</a></span>crew, those blights and
blasts of all that is human in man and child."[B]</p>

<p>There must, however, be many parents still living who remember
the delight that the little story gave them in their younger days,
and they will, no doubt, be pleased to see it once more in the form
which was then so familiar to them. The children of to-day, too,
will look on it with some curiosity, on account of the fact that it
is one of the oldest of our nursery tales, and amused and edified
their grand-parents and great grand-parents when they were
children, while they cannot fail to be attracted by its simple,
pretty, and interesting story.</p>

<hr width="30%">
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexi" id="pagexi">[xi]</a></span>

<p>The question of the authorship of the book is still an unsettled
one. It was at one time commonly attributed to Oliver Goldsmith,
and no one who reads the book will consider it to be unworthy of
the poet's pen. We find, however, in Nichol's Literary Anecdotes,
that</p>

<p>"It is not perhaps generally known that to Mr Griffith Jones,
and a brother of his, Mr Giles Jones, in conjunction with Mr John
Newbery, the public are indebted for the origin of those numerous
and popular little books for the amusement and instruction of
children which have been ever since received with universal
approbation. The Lilliputian histories of Goody Two Shoes, Giles
Gingerbread, Tommy Trip, &amp;c., &amp;c., are remarkable proofs of
the benevolent minds of the projectors of this plan of <span class=
"newpage"><a name="pagexii" id=
"pagexii">[xii]</a></span>instruction, and respectable instances of
the accommodation of superior talents to the feeble intellects of
infantine felicity."</p>

<p>Mr Giles Jones was the grandfather of the late Mr Winter Jones,
formerly the Principal Librarian of the British Museum, and the
book is attributed to the first-named gentleman in the catalogue of
the British Museum. It is claimed also that the book offers
internal evidence in support of Mr Giles Jones' authorship,
inasmuch as Goody Two Shoes becomes Lady Jones, and one of the
prominent families in the book is also named Jones.</p>

<p>Beyond this, however, there appears to be no evidence as to Mr
Giles Jones being the writer, and I think something may be said as
to the claim on behalf of the poet Goldsmith, although I am by no
means anxious that the <span class="newpage"><a name="pagexiii" id=
"pagexiii">[xiii]</a></span>honour of having written it should be
ascribed either to the one or to the other: the following remarks,
which are mainly taken from an article I contributed to the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> in April 1881, are offered simply as
speculations which may not be without interest to lovers of the
little book. They may, perhaps, show that there is some reason for
attributing the work to Oliver Goldsmith, although, of course, it
is not claimed that they absolutely establish the fact.</p>

<p>Having occasion to examine carefully as many of the books for
children published by John Newbery as I could procure (and they are
as scarce as blackberries in midwinter, for what among books has so
brief a life as a nursery book?), I was struck while perusing them
with a certain distinct literary flavour, so to <span class=
"newpage"><a name="pagexiv" id="pagexiv">[xiv]</a></span>speak,
which appeared to be common to a group of little volumes, all
published about the same period. These were: "Goody Two Shoes,"
"Giles Gingerbread," "Tom Thumb's Folio," "The Lilliputian
Magazine," "The Lilliputian Masquerade," "The Easter Gift," "A
Pretty Plaything," "The Fairing," "Be Merry and Wise," "The
Valentine's Gift," "Pretty Poems for the Amusement of Children
Three Feet High," "A Pretty Book of Pictures," "Tom Telescope," and
a few others. I give abbreviated titles only, but if space
permitted I mould like to quote them in full; they are remarkable
no less for their curious quaintness and their clever ingenuity
than for their attractiveness to both parents (who, it must not be
forgotten, are more often the real buyers <span class="newpage"><a
name="pagexv" id="pagexv">[xv]</a></span>of children's books) and
the young people for whom they were written, and they are in
themselves most entertaining and amusing reading. This group of
little books possesses, moreover, another characteristic that is
sufficiently remarkable of itself to be noticed. While they all
evince a real genius for writing in a style suited to the
capacities of little folk, there is a nameless something about them
which, far more than is the case with thousands of other books for
the young, is calculated to enforce the attention and excite the
interest of "children of a larger growth."</p>

<p>Now one of this little group, "The Lilliputian Magazine," is
attributed in the British Museum Catalogue to Oliver Goldsmith; and
so strong is the family likeness in all the books I have mentioned,
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexvi" id=
"pagexvi">[xvi]</a></span>that I cannot but believe they are all by
the same hand--a belief which I think will be shared by any one who
will take the trouble to compare them carefully. But I should
advise him to rely on the Newbery editions alone, for grievously
garbled versions of nearly every one of these books have been
issued from many different houses throughout the country.</p>

<p>Many authorities have supported the view that Goldsmith was the
author of "Goody Two Shoes." Conspicuous among them was Washington
Irving, who says, "It is suggested with great probability that he
wrote for Mr Newbery the famous nursery story of 'Goody Two
Shoes.'" It is said also that William Godwin held this opinion; and
I believe there is authority for <span class="newpage"><a name=
"pagexvii" id="pagexvii">[xvii]</a></span>stating that the Misses
Bewick, the daughters of the celebrated engraver, who illustrated
an edition of the book for T. Saint, of Newcastle, understood from
their father that it was by Oliver Goldsmith.</p>

<p>But let us turn to the book itself and see if it furnishes any
evidence on the point. The very title, with its quaint phrasing,
shows no common genius, and as Washington Irving says, "bears the
stamp of his [Goldsmith's] sly and playful humour." As the book was
published in 1765, it would most likely have been written just at
the time when Goldsmith was working most industriously in the
service of Newbery (1763-4), at which period it will be remembered
that he was living near Newbery at Islington, and his publisher was
paying for his board and lodging.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexviii" id=
"pagexviii">[xviii]</a></span>

<p>Without, of course, claiming that similarity of idea in
different writings necessarily betokens the same authorship, I
think the parallels that are to be found in this little book, with
many of the sentiments in Oliver Goldsmith's acknowledged work--to
say nothing of the almost universally recognized likeness to
Goldsmith's style that is found in "Goody Two Shoes" may fairly be
considered as throwing some light upon the question.</p>

<p>The most striking of these parallels is perhaps that furnished
by the curious little political preface to the work--a preface
which is quite unnecessary to the book, and I think would only have
been inserted by one who was full of the unjustnesses at which he
was preparing to aim a still heavier blow. In <span class=
"newpage"><a name="pagexix" id="pagexix">[xix]</a></span>describing
the parish of Mouldwell, where little Margery was born, an exact
picture is drawn of "The Deserted Village," where</p>

<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;One only master grasps the whole domain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And half a tillage tints thy smiling plain;</small></p>

<p>And where</p>

<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---- the man of
wealth and pride<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Takes up a space that many a poor supplied:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Space for his lakes his park's extended bounds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Space for his horses, equipage, and hounds.</small></p>

<p>And by this and other tyrannies, and being also</p>

<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;Scourged by famine from the smiling
land,</small></p>

<p>for he was "unfortunate in his business" at about the same time,
Sir Timothy accomplishes his aim, and</p>

<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;Indignant spurns the cottage from the
green.</small></p>

<p>Ruined by this oppression, poor Mr <span class="newpage"><a
name="pagexx" id="pagexx">[xx]</a></span>Meanwell is turned out of
doors,<br>
and flew to another parish for succour.</p>

<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, then, ah! where shall poverty
reside<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To 'scape the pressure of contiguous pride?</small></p>

<p>Sir Timothy, however, suffers for his injustice and wickedness,
for "great part of the land lay untilled for some years, which was
deemed a just reward for such diabolical proceedings."</p>

<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a
prey,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where wealth accumulates and men decay.</small></p>

<p>Miss Charlotte Yonge, to whom I shall refer again, lays upon
this: "If the conjecture be true which attributes this tale to
Oliver Goldsmith, we have seen the same spirit which prompted his
poem of 'The Deserted Village,' namely, indignation and dismay at
the discouragement of small holdings in the early part <span class=
"newpage"><a name="pagexxi" id="pagexxi">[xxi]</a></span>of the
eighteenth century."[C] Indeed, it may well be that we have in this
preface even a more true picture of Lissoy than that given in the
poem, which, as Mr William Black says in his monograph on
Goldsmith, "is there seen through the softening and beautifying
mist of years."</p>

<p>Much more might be said of the characteristics of this little
book, which contains so much that reminds us not only of the style
but the matter of many of Goldsmith's writings. Miss Yonge says:
"There is a certain dry humour in some passages and a tenderness in
others that incline us much to the belief that it could come from
no one else but the writer of 'The Vicar of Wakefield' <span class=
"newpage"><a name="pagexxii" id="pagexxii">[xxii]</a></span>and
'The Deserted Village.' Indeed, we could almost imagine that Dr
Primrose himself had described the panic at the supposed ghost in
the church in the same tone as the ride to church, the family
portrait, or the gross of green spectacles.'[D] We find in "Goody
Two Shoes" every one of those distinctive qualities of Goldsmith's
writings which Mr William Black so well summarizes in the book
already referred to--"his genuine and tender pathos, that never at
any time verges on the affected or theatrical;" his "quaint,
delicate, delightful humour;" his "broader humour, that is not
afraid to provoke the wholesome laughter of mankind by dealing with
common and familiar ways <span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxiii"
id="pagexxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>and manners and men;" his
"choiceness of diction;" his "lightness and grace of touch, that
lend a charm even to" his "ordinary hack work."</p>

<hr width="30%">
<p>The reprint which is here presented is a photographic facsimile
of the earliest complete copy that we have been able to procure.
Judging from fragments of earlier editions in the possession of the
publishers, it would appear to be printed from exactly the same
types as the original issue of April 1765. The copy from which the
reprint is made was kindly lent to the publishers by Mr Ernest
Hartley Coleridge, whose collection at the South Kensington Museum
of eighteenth century books for children is well known. The actual
size of that book is 4 inches by 2-3/4, but it has been thought
better to print on somewhat larger paper. The original is bound in
the once familiar Dutch flowered and gilt pattern paper, and we had
hoped to present the <span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxiv" id=
"pagexxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>reprint in a similar cover, but it was
found impossible, as nothing like it could be procured, nor could
the manufacturers of the present day exactly reproduce it.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By
the Editor.</p>

<p>All the World must allow, that <i>Two Shoes</i> was not her real
Name. No; her Father's Name was <i>Meanwell</i>; and he was for
many Years a considerable Farmer in the Parish where <i>Margery</i>
was born; but by the <span class="newpage"><a name="page5" id=
"page5">[5]</a></span>Misfortunes which he met with in Business,
and the wicked Persecutions of Sir <i>Timothy Gripe</i>, and an
over-grown Farmer called <i>Graspall</i>, he was effectually
ruined.</p>

<p>The Case was thus. The Parish of <i>Mouldwell</i> where they
lived, had for many Ages been let by the Lord of the Manor into
twelve different Farms, in which the Tenants lived comfortably,
brought up large Families, and carefully supported the poor People
who laboured for them; until the Estate by Marriage and by Death
came into the Hands of Sir <i>Timothy</i>.</p>

<p>This Gentleman, who loved himself better than all his
Neighbours, thought it less Trouble to write one Receipt for his
Rent than twelve, and Farmer <i>Graspall</i> offering to take all
the Farms as the Leases expired, Sir <i>Timothy</i> agreed with
him, and in Process of <span class="newpage"><a name="page6" id=
"page6">[6]</a></span>Time he was possessed of every Farm, but that
occupied by little <i>Margery's</i> Father; which he also wanted;
for as Mr. <i>Meanwell</i> was a charitable good Man, he stood up
for the Poor at the Parish Meetings, and was unwilling to have them
oppressed by Sir <i>Timothy</i>, and this avaricious
Farmer.--Judge, oh kind, humane and courteous Reader, what a
terrible Situation the Poor must be in, when this covetous Man was
perpetual Overseer, and every Thing for their Maintenance was drawn
from his hard Heart and cruel Hand. But he was not only perpetual
Overseer, but perpetual Church-warden; and judge, oh ye Christians,
what State the Church must be in, when supported by a Man without
Religion or Virtue. He was also perpetual Surveyor of the Highways,
and what Sort of Roads he kept up for the <span class="newpage"><a
name="page7" id="page7">[7]</a></span>Convenience of Travellers,
those best know who have had the Misfortune to be obliged to pass
thro' that Parish.--Complaints indeed were made, but to what
Purpose are Complaints, when brought against a Man, who can hunt,
drink, and smoak with the Lord of the Manor, who is also the
Justice of Peace?</p>

<p>The Opposition which little <i>Margery's</i> Father made to this
Man's Tyranny, gave Offence to Sir <i>Timothy</i>, who endeavoured
to force him out of his Farm; and to oblige him to throw up the
Lease, ordered both a Brick Kiln and a Dog-kennel to be erected in
the Farmer's Orchard. This was contrary to Law, and a Suit was
commenced, in which <i>Margery's</i> Father got the better. The
same Offence was again committed three different Times, and as many
Actions brought, <span class="newpage"><a name="page8" id=
"page8">[8]</a></span>in all of which the Farmer had a Verdict and
Costs paid him; but notwithstanding these Advantages, the Law was
so expensive, that he was ruined in the Contest, and obliged to
give up all he had to his Creditors; which effectually answered the
Purpose of Sir <i>Timothy</i>, who erected those Nuisances in the
Farmer's Orchard with that Intention only. Ah, my dear Reader, we
brag of Liberty, and boast of our Laws: but the Blessings of the
one, and the Protection of the other, seldom fall to the Lot of the
Poor; and especially when a rich Man is their Adversary. How, in
the Name of Goodness, can a poor Wretch obtain Redress, when thirty
Pounds are insufficient to try his Cause? Where is he to find Money
to see Council, or how can he plead his Cause himself (even if he
<span class="newpage"><a name="page9" id="page9">[9]</a></span>was
permitted) when our Laws are so obscure, and so multiplied, that an
Abridgment of them cannot be contained in fifty Volumes in
Folio?</p>

"turned the Farmer, his Wife, little Margery, and her Brother out of Doors"
 border="0" align="right">

<p>As soon as Mr. <i>Meanwell</i> had called together his
Creditors, Sir <i>Timothy</i> seized for a Year's Rent, and turned
the Farmer, his Wife, little <i>Margery</i>, and her Brother out of
Doors, without any of the Necessaries of Life to support them.</p>

<p>[Illustration]</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page10" id="page10">[10]</a></span>

<p>This elated the Heart of Mr. <i>Graspall</i>, this crowned his
Hopes, and filled the Measure of his Iniquity; for besides
gratifying his Revenge, this Man's Overthrow gave him the sole
Dominion of the Poor, whom he depressed and abused in a Manner too
horrible to mention.</p>

<p><i>Margery's</i> Father flew into another Parish for Succour,
and all those who were able to move left their Dwellings and sought
Employment elsewhere, as they found it would be impossible to live
under the Tyranny of two such People. The very old, the very lame
and the blind were obliged to stay behind, and whether they were
starved, or what became of them, History does not say; but the
Character of the great Sir <i>Timothy</i>, and his avaricious
Tenant, were so infamous, that nobody would work for them by the
Day, and <span class="newpage"><a name="page11" id=
"page11">[11]</a></span>Servants were afraid to engage themselves
by the Year, lest any unforeseen Accident should leave them
Parishioners in a Place, where they knew they must perish
miserably; so that great Part of the Land lay untilled for some
Years, which was deemed a just Reward for such diabolical
Proceedings.</p>

<p>But what, says the Reader, can occasion all this? Do you intend
this for Children, Mr. N<small>EWBERY</small>? Why, do you suppose
this is written by Mr. N<small>EWBERY</small>, Sir? This may come
from another Hand. This is not the Book, Sir, mentioned in the
Title, but the Introduction to that Book; and it is intended, Sir,
not for those Sort of Children, but for Children of six Feet high,
of which, as my Friend has justly observed, there are many Millions
in the Kingdom; and these <span class="newpage"><a name="page12"
id="page12">[12]</a></span>Reflections, Sir, have been rendered
necessary, by the unaccountable and diabolical Scheme which many
Gentlemen now give into, of laying a Number of Farms into one, and
very often of a whole Parish into one Farm; which in the End must
reduce the common People to a State of Vassalage, worse than that
under the Barons of old, or of the Clans in <i>Scotland</i>; and
will in Time depopulate the Kingdom. But as you are tired of the
Subject, I shall take myself away, and you may visit <i>Little
Margery</i>. So, Sir, your Servant,</p>

<h3>C&nbsp;&nbsp;H&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;P. &nbsp;&nbsp;I.</h3>

<p><i>How and about Little</i> Margery <i>and her</i> Brother.</p>
</center>

<center><img src="images/image03.png" width="256" height="209" alt=
"Margery' father seized with a violent Fever" border="0"></center>

<p>Care and Discontent shortened the Days of Little
<i>Margery's</i> Father.--He was forced from his Family, and seized
with a violent Fever in a Place where Dr. <i>James's</i> Powder was
not to be had, and where he died miserably. <i>Margery's</i> poor
Mother survived the Loss of her Husband but a few Days, and died of
a broken Heart, leaving <i>Margery</i> and her little Brother to
the wide World; but, poor Woman, it would have melted your Heart to
have seen how frequently she heaved up her Head, while she lay
speechless, to survey with languishing Looks her little Orphans,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page14" id=
"page14">[14]</a></span>as much as to say, <i>Do Tommy, do Margery,
come with me</i>. They cried, poor Things, and she sighed away her
Soul; and I hope is happy.</p>

<p>It would both have excited your Pity, and have done your Heart
good, to have seen how fond these two little ones were of each
other, and how, Hand in Hand, they trotted about. Pray see
them.</p>

<center><img src="images/image04.png" width="260" height="218" alt=
"Hand in Hand" border="0"></center>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page15" id="page15">[15]</a></span>

<p>They were both very ragged, and <i>Tommy</i> had two Shoes, but
<i>Margery</i> had but one. They had nothing, poor Things, to
support them (not being in their own Parish) but what they picked
from the Hedges, or got from the poor People, and they lay every
Night in a Barn. Their Relations took no Notice of them; no, they
were rich, and ashamed to own <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page16" id="page16">[16]</a></span>such a poor little ragged Girl
as <i>Margery</i>, and such a dirty little curl-pated Boy as
<i>Tommy</i>. Our Relations and Friends seldom take Notice of us
when we are poor; but as we grow rich they grow fond. And this will
always be the Case, while People love Money better than Virtue, or
better than they do G<small>OD</small> Almighty. But such wicked
Folks, who love nothing but Money, and are proud and despise the
Poor, never come to any good in the End, as we shall see by and
by.</p>

<h3>C&nbsp;&nbsp;H&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;P. &nbsp;&nbsp;II.</h3>

<p><i>How and about Mr.</i> Smith.</p>
</center>

<center><img src="images/image05.png" width="268" height="211" alt=
"Mr. Smith" border="0"></center>

<p>Mr. <i>Smith</i> was a very worthy Clergyman, who lived in the
Parish where Little <i>Margery</i> and <span class="newpage"><a
name="page17" id="page17">[17]</a></span><i>Tommy</i> were born;
and having a Relation come to see him, who was a charitable good
Man, he sent for these Children to him. The Gentleman ordered
Little <i>Margery</i> a new Pair of Shoes, gave Mr. <i>Smith</i>
some Money to buy her Cloathes; and said, he would take
<i>Tommy</i> and make him a little Sailor; and accordingly had a
Jacket and Trowsers made for him, in which he now appears. Pray
look at him.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page18" id="page18">[18]</a></span>

<p>After some Days the Gentleman intended to go to <i>London</i>,
and take little <i>Tommy</i> with him, of whom you will know more
by and by, for we shall at a proper Time present you with some Part
of his History, his Travels and Adventures.</p>

<img src="images/image06.png" width="171" height="139" alt=
"Tommy wiped off her Tears with the End of his Jacket" border="0"
align="right">

<p>The Parting between these two little Children was very
affecting, <i>Tommy</i> cried, and <i>Margery</i> cried, and they
kissed each other an hundred Times. At last <i>Tommy</i> thus wiped
off her Tears <span class="newpage"><a name="page19" id=
"page19">[19]</a></span>with the End of his Jacket, and bid her cry
no more, for that he would come to her again, when he returned from
Sea. However, as they were so very fond, the Gentleman would not
suffer them to take Leave of each other; but told <i>Tommy</i> he
should ride out with him, and come back at Night. When night came,
Little <i>Margery</i> grew very uneasy about her Brother, and after
sitting up as late as Mr. <i>Smith</i> would let her, she went
crying to Bed.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<center>
<h3>C&nbsp;&nbsp;H&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;P. &nbsp;&nbsp;III.</h3>

<p><i>How Little</i> Margery <i>obtained the Name of</i><br>
Goody Two-Shoes, <i>and what happened in the Parish.</i></p>
</center>

<img src="images/image07.png" width="369" height="297" alt=
"Two Shoes, Mame, see two Shoes" border="0" align="left">

<p>As soon as Little <i>Margery</i> got up in the Morning, which
was <span class="newpage"><a name="page20" id=
"page20">[20]</a></span>very early, she ran all round the Village,
crying for her Brother; and after some Time returned greatly
distressed. However, at this Instant, the Shoemaker very
opportunely came in with the new Shoes, for which she had been
measured by the Gentleman's Order.</p>

<p>Nothing could have supported Little <i>Margery</i> under the
Affliction she was in for the Loss of her Brother, but the Pleasure
she took in her <i>two Shoes</i>. She ran out to Mrs. <i>Smith</i>
as soon as they were put on, and stroking down her ragged Apron
thus, <span class="newpage"><a name="page21" id=
"page21">[21]</a></span>cried out, <i>Two Shoes, Mame, see two
Shoes</i>. And so she behaved to all the People she met, and by
that Means obtained the Name of <i>Goody Two-Shoes</i>, though her
Playmates called her <i>Old Goody Two-Shoes</i>.</p>

<p>Little <i>Margery</i> was very happy in being with Mr. and Mrs.
<i>Smith</i>, who were very charitable and good to her, and had
agreed to breed her up with <span class="newpage"><a name="page22"
id="page22">[22]</a></span>their Family; but as soon as that Tyrant
of the Parish, that <i>Graspall</i>, heard of her being there, he
applied first to Mr. <i>Smith</i>, and threatened to reduce his
Tythes if he kept her; and after that he spoke to Sir
<i>Timothy</i>, who sent Mr. <i>Smith</i> a peremptory Message by
his Servant, that <i>he should send back</i> Meanwell's <i>Girl to
be kept by her Relations, and not harbour her in the Parish</i>.
This so distressed Mr. <i>Smith</i> that he shed Tears, and cried,
<i>Lord have Mercy on the Poor!</i></p>

<p>The Prayers of the Righteous fly upwards, and reach unto the
Throne of Heaven, as will be seen in the Sequel.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Smith</i> was also greatly concerned at being thus
obliged to discard poor Little <i>Margery</i>. She kissed her and
cried; <span class="newpage"><a name="page23" id=
"page23">[23]</a></span>as also did Mr. <i>Smith</i>, but they were
obliged to send her away; for the People who had ruined her Father
could at any Time have ruined them.</p>

<h3>C&nbsp;&nbsp;H&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;P. &nbsp;&nbsp;IV.</h3>

<p><i>How Little</i> Margery <i>learned to read,<br>
and by Degrees taught others.</i></p>
</center>

<p>Little <i>Margery</i> saw how good, and how wise Mr.
<i>Smith</i> was, and concluded, that this was owing to his great
Learning, therefore she wanted of all Things to learn to read. For
this Purpose she used to meet the little Boys and Girls as they
came from School, borrow their Books, and sit down and read till
they returned;</p>

<center><img src="images/image09.png" width="354" height="293" alt=
"Boys and Girls sit down and read" border="0"></center>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page25" id="page25">[25]</a></span>

<p>By this Means she soon got more Learning than any of her
Playmates, and laid the following Scheme for instructing those who
were more ignorant than herself. She found, that only the following
Letters were required to spell all the Words in the World; but as
some of these Letters are large and some small, she with<span
class="newpage"><a name="page26" id="page26">[26]</a></span> her
Knife cut out of several Pieces of Wood ten Setts of each of
these:</p>

<center>a&nbsp;&nbsp; b&nbsp;&nbsp; c&nbsp;&nbsp; d&nbsp;&nbsp;
e&nbsp;&nbsp; f&nbsp;&nbsp; g&nbsp;&nbsp; h&nbsp;&nbsp;
i&nbsp;&nbsp; j&nbsp;&nbsp; k&nbsp;&nbsp; l&nbsp;&nbsp;
m&nbsp;&nbsp; n&nbsp;&nbsp; o<br>
p&nbsp;&nbsp; q &nbsp;&nbsp;r &nbsp;&nbsp;(s) &nbsp;&nbsp;s
&nbsp;&nbsp;t &nbsp;&nbsp;u &nbsp;&nbsp;v &nbsp;&nbsp;w
&nbsp;&nbsp;x &nbsp;&nbsp;y &nbsp;&nbsp;z.<br>
</center>

<p><small>[Post-processor's note: (s) is an old-English style
non-terminating letter "s".]</small></p>

<center>And six Setts of these:<br>
<br>
A&nbsp;&nbsp; B&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp; D&nbsp;&nbsp;
E&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp; G&nbsp;&nbsp; H&nbsp;&nbsp;
I&nbsp;&nbsp; K&nbsp;&nbsp; L&nbsp;&nbsp; M&nbsp;&nbsp;
N&nbsp;&nbsp; O<br>
P&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp; R&nbsp;&nbsp; S&nbsp;&nbsp;
T&nbsp;&nbsp; U&nbsp;&nbsp; V&nbsp;&nbsp; W&nbsp;&nbsp;
X&nbsp;&nbsp; Y&nbsp;&nbsp; Z.<br>
</center>

<p>And having got an old Spelling-Book, she made her Companions set
up all the Words they wanted to spell, and after that she taught
them to compose Sentences. You know what a Sentence is, my Dear,
<i>I will be good</i>, is a Sentence; and is made up, as you see,
of several Words.</p>

<p>The usual Manner of Spelling, or carrying on the Game, as they
called <span class="newpage"><a name="page27" id=
"page27">[27]</a></span>it, was this: Suppose the Word to be spelt
was Plumb Pudding (and who can suppose a better) the Children were
placed in a Circle, and the first brought the Letter <i>P</i>, the
next <i>l</i>, the next <i>u</i>, the next <i>m</i>, and so on till
the Whole was spelt; and if any one brought a wrong Letter, he was
to pay a Fine, or play no more. This was at their Play; and every
Morning she used to go round to teach the Children with these
Rattle-traps in a Basket, as you see in the Print.</p>

<center><img src="images/image10.png" width="275" height="212" alt=

<span class="newpage"><a name="page28" id="page28">[28]</a></span>

<p>I once went her Rounds with her, and was highly diverted, as you
may be, if you please to look into the next Chapter.</p>

<p><i>How Little</i> Two-Shoes <i>became a trotting Tutoress<br>
and how she taught her young Pupils.</i></p>
</center>

<p>It was about seven o'Clock in the Morning when we set out on
this <span class="newpage"><a name="page29" id=
"page29">[29]</a></span>important Business, and the first House we
came to was Farmer <i>Wilson's</i>. See here it is.</p>

<center><img src="images/image11.png" width="344" height="285" alt=
"Farmer Wilson's house" border="0"></center>

<p>Here <i>Margery</i> stopped, and ran up to the Door, <i>Tap,
tap, tap</i>. Who's there? Only little goody <i>Two-Shoes</i>,
answered <i>Margery</i>, come to teach <i>Billy</i>. Oh Little
<i>Goody</i>, says Mrs. <i>Wilson</i>, with Pleasure in her Face, I
am glad to see you, <i>Billy</i> wants <span class="newpage"><a
name="page30" id="page30">[30]</a></span>you sadly, for he has
learned all his Lesson. Then out came the little Boy. <i>How do
doody Two-Shoes</i>, says he, not able to speak plain. Yet this
little Boy had learned all his Letters; for she threw down this
Alphabet mixed together thus:</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page31" id="page31">[31]</a></span>

<center>b&nbsp;&nbsp; d&nbsp;&nbsp; f&nbsp;&nbsp; h&nbsp;&nbsp;

a&nbsp;&nbsp; c&nbsp;&nbsp; e&nbsp;&nbsp; g&nbsp;&nbsp;

r&nbsp;&nbsp; t&nbsp;&nbsp; v&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp; j<br>
<br>
</center>

<p>and he picked them up, called them by their right Names, and put
them all in order thus:</p>

<center>a&nbsp;&nbsp; b&nbsp;&nbsp; c&nbsp;&nbsp; d&nbsp;&nbsp;
e&nbsp;&nbsp; f&nbsp;&nbsp; g&nbsp;&nbsp; h&nbsp;&nbsp;

s&nbsp;&nbsp; t&nbsp;&nbsp; u&nbsp;&nbsp; v&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
</center>

<p><small>[Post-processor's note: (s) is an old-English style
non-terminating letter "s".]</small></p>

<p>She then threw down the Alphabet of Capital Letters in the
Manner you here see them.</p>

<center>B&nbsp;&nbsp; D&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp; H&nbsp;&nbsp;
K&nbsp;&nbsp; M&nbsp;&nbsp; O&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;

R&nbsp;&nbsp; T&nbsp;&nbsp; V&nbsp;&nbsp; X&nbsp;&nbsp; J.<br>
<br>
</center>

<p>and he picked them all up, and having told their Names, placed
them thus:</p>

<center>A&nbsp;&nbsp; B&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp; D&nbsp;&nbsp;
E&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp; G&nbsp;&nbsp; H&nbsp;&nbsp;

V&nbsp;&nbsp; W&nbsp;&nbsp; X&nbsp;&nbsp; Y&nbsp;&nbsp; Z.<br>
<br>
</center>

<p>Now, pray little Reader, take this Bodkin, and see if you can
point out the Letters from these mixed Alphabets, and tell how they
should be placed as well as little Boy <i>Billy</i>.</p>

<p>The next Place we came to was Farmer <i>Simpson's</i>, and here
it is.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page32" id="page32">[32]</a></span>

<center><img src="images/image12.png" width="344" height="277" alt=

<p><i>Bow wow, wow</i>, says the Dog at the Door. Sirrah, says his
Mistress, what do you bark at Little <i>Two-Shoes</i>. Come in
<i>Madge</i>; here, <i>Sally</i> wants you sadly, she has learned
all her Lesson. Then out came the little one: So <i>Madge!</i> say
she; so <i>Sally!</i> answered the other, have you learned your
Lesson? Yes, that's what I have, replied the little one in <span
class="newpage"><a name="page33" id="page33">[33]</a></span>the
Country Manner; and immediately taking the Letters she set up these
Syllables:</p>

<center>ba&nbsp;&nbsp; be&nbsp;&nbsp; bi&nbsp;&nbsp; bo&nbsp;&nbsp;
bu,&nbsp;&nbsp; ca&nbsp;&nbsp; ce&nbsp;&nbsp; ci&nbsp;&nbsp;
co&nbsp;&nbsp; cu<br>
da&nbsp;&nbsp; de&nbsp;&nbsp; di&nbsp;&nbsp; do&nbsp;&nbsp;
du,&nbsp;&nbsp; fa&nbsp;&nbsp; fe&nbsp;&nbsp; fi&nbsp;&nbsp;
so&nbsp;&nbsp; fu.<br>
<br>
</center>

<p>and gave them their exact Sounds as she composed them; after
which she set up the following;</p>

<center>ac&nbsp;&nbsp; ec&nbsp;&nbsp; ic&nbsp;&nbsp; oc&nbsp;&nbsp;
uc,&nbsp;&nbsp; ad&nbsp;&nbsp; ed&nbsp;&nbsp; id&nbsp;&nbsp;
od&nbsp;&nbsp; ud<br>
af&nbsp;&nbsp; ef&nbsp;&nbsp; if&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp;
uf,&nbsp;&nbsp; ag&nbsp;&nbsp; eg&nbsp;&nbsp; ig&nbsp;&nbsp;
og&nbsp;&nbsp; ug.<br>
<br>
</center>

<p>And pronounced them likewise. She then sung the Cuzz's Chorus
(which may be found in the <i>Little Pretty Play Thing</i>,
published by Mr.
N<small>&nbsp;E&nbsp;W&nbsp;B&nbsp;E&nbsp;R&nbsp;Y</small>) and to
the same Tune to which it is there set.</p>

<p>After this, Little <i>Two-Shoes</i> taught her to spell Words of
one Syllable, <span class="newpage"><a name="page34" id=
"page34">[34]</a></span>and she soon set up Pear, Plumb. Top, Ball,
Pin, Puss, Dog, Hog, Fawn, Buck, Doe, Lamb, Sheep, Ram, Cow, Bull,
Cock, Hen, and many more.</p>

<p>The next Place we came to was <i>Gaffer Cook's</i> Cottage;
there you see it before you.</p>

<center><img src="images/image13.png" width="349" height="278" alt=
"Gaffer Cook's Cottage" border="0"></center>

<p>Here a number of poor Children were met to learn; who all came
<span class="newpage"><a name="page35" id=
"page35">[35]</a></span>round Little <i>Margery</i> at once; and,
having pulled out her Letters, she asked the little Boy next her,
what he had for Dinner? Who answered, <i>Bread</i>. (the poor
Children in many Places live very hard) Well then, says she, set
the first Letter. He put up the Letter B, to which the next added
r, and the next e, the next a, the next d, and it stood thus,
<i>Bread</i>.</p>

<p>And what had you <i>Polly Comb</i> for your Dinner?
<i>Apple-pye</i> answered the little Girl: Upon which the next in
Turn set up a great A, the two next a p each, and so on till the
two Words Apple and Pye were united and stood thus,
<i>Apple-pye</i>.</p>

<p>The next had <i>Potatoes</i>, the next <i>Beef and Turnip</i>
which were spelt with many others, till the Game <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page36" id="page36">[36]</a></span>of Spelling
was finished. She then set them another Task, and we proceeded.</p>

<p>The next Place we came to was Farmer <i>Thompson's</i>, where
there were a great many little ones waiting for her.</p>

<p>So little Mrs. <i>Goody Two-Shoes</i>, says one of them, where
have you been so long? I have been teaching, says she, longer than
I intended, and am afraid I am come too soon for you now. No, but
indeed you are not, replied the other; for I have got my Lesson,
and so has <i>Sally Dawson</i>, and so has <i>Harry Wilson</i>, and
so we have all; and they capered about as if they were overjoyed to
see her. Why then, says she, you are all very good, and
G<small>OD</small> Almighty will love you; so let us begin our
Lessons. They all huddled round <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page37" id="page37">[37]</a></span>her, and though at the other
Place they were employed about Words and Syllables, here we had
People of much greater Understanding who dealt only in
Sentences.</p>

<p>The Letters being brought upon the Table, one of the little ones
set up the following Sentence.</p>

<p><i>The Lord have Mercy upon me, and grant that I may be always
good, and say my Prayers, and love the Lord my God with all my
Heart, with all my Soul, and with all my Strength; and honour the
King, and all good Men in Authority under him.</i></p>

<p>Then the next took the Letters, and composed this Sentence.</p>

<p><i>Lord have Mercy upon me, and grant that I may love my
Neighbour as myself, and do unto all Men as I would have them do
unto me, and tell no Lies; but be honest and just in all my
Dealings.</i></p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page38" id="page38">[38]</a></span>

<p>The third composed the following Sentence.</p>

<p><i>The Lord have Mercy upon me, and grant that I may honour my
Father and Mother, and love my Brothers and Sisters, Relations and
Friends, and all my Playmates, and every Body, and endeavour to
make them happy.</i></p>

<p>The fourth composed the following.</p>

<p><i>I pray</i> G<small>OD</small> <i>to bless this whole Company,
and all our Friends, and all our Enemies.</i></p>

<p>To this last <i>Polly Sullen</i> objected, and said, truly, she
did not know why she should pray for her Enemies? Not pray for your
Enemies, says Little <i>Margery</i>; yes, you must, you are no
Christian, if you don't forgive your Enemies, and do Good for Evil.
<i>Polly</i> still pouted; upon which Little <i>Margery</i> said,
though she was <span class="newpage"><a name="page39" id=
"page39">[39]</a></span>poor, and obliged to lie in a Barn, she
would not keep Company with such a naughty, proud, perverse Girl as
<i>Polly</i>; and was going away; however the Difference was made
up, and she set them to compose the following</p>

<br>
<center><big>L&nbsp;&nbsp; E&nbsp;&nbsp; S&nbsp;&nbsp;
S&nbsp;&nbsp; O&nbsp;&nbsp; N&nbsp;&nbsp; S</big>

<p>For&nbsp; the&nbsp;
C<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;O&nbsp;&nbsp;N&nbsp;&nbsp;
D&nbsp;&nbsp;U&nbsp;&nbsp;C&nbsp;&nbsp;T</small>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp; L&nbsp;I&nbsp;F&nbsp;E.</p>

<p>As we were returning Home, we saw a Gentleman, who was very ill,
sitting under a shady Tree at the Corner of his Rookery. Though
ill, he began to joke with Little <i>Margery</i>, and said,
laughingly, so, <i>Goody Two-Shoes</i>, they tell me you are a
cunning little Baggage; pray, can you tell me what I shall do to
get well? Yes, Sir, says she, go to Bed when <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page44" id="page44">[44]</a></span>your Rooks
do. You see they are going to Rest already:</p>

<center><img src="images/image14.png" width="351" height="291" alt=
"they are going to Rest" border="0"></center>

<p>Do you so likewise, and get up with them in the morning; earn,
as they do, every Day what you eat, and eat and drink no more than
you earn; and you'll get Health and keep it. What should induce the
Rooks to frequent Gentlemens Houses only, but to tell them how to
lead a <span class="newpage"><a name="page45" id=
"page45">[45]</a></span>prudent Life? They never build over
Cottages or Farm-houses, because they see, that these People know
how to live without their Admonition.</p>

<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus Health and Wit you may improve,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Taught by the Tenants of the Grove.</i></p>

<p>The Gentleman laughing gave <i>Margery</i> Sixpence; and told
her she was a sensible Hussey.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<center>
<h3>C&nbsp;&nbsp;H&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;P. &nbsp;&nbsp;VI.</h3>

<p><i>How the whole Parish was frighted.</i></p>
</center>

<p>Who does not know Lady <i>Ducklington</i>, or who does not know
that she was buried at this Parish Church?</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page46" id="page46">[xxx]</a></span>


<center><img src="images/image15.png" width="366" height="284" alt=
"Parish Church" border="0"></center>

<p>Well, I never saw so grand a Funeral in all my Life; but the
Money they squandered away, would have been better laid out in
little Books for Children, or in Meat, Drink, and Cloaths for the
Poor.</p>

<img src="images/image16.png" width="299" height="233" alt=
"Fine Hearse" border="0" align="left">

<p>This if a fine Hearse indeed, and the nodding Plumes on the
Horses <span class="newpage"><a name="page47" id=
"page47">[47]</a></span>look very grand; but what End does that
answer, otherwise than to display the Pride of the Living, or the
Vanity of the Dead. Fie upon such Folly, say I, and Heaven grant
that those who want more Sense may have it.</p>

<p>But all the Country round came to see the Burying, and it was
late before the Corpse was interred. <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page48" id="page48">[48]</a></span>After which, in the Night, or
rather about Four o'Clock in the Morning, the Bells were heard to
jingle in the Steeple, which frightened the People prodigiously,
who all thought it was Lady <i>Ducklington</i> 's Ghost dancing
among the Bell-ropes. The People flocked to <i>Will Dobbins</i> the
Clerk, and wanted him to go and see what it was; but <i>William</i>
said, he was sure it was a Ghost, and that he would not offer to
open the Door. At length Mr. <i>Long</i> the Rector, hearing such
an Uproar in the Village, went to the Clerk, to know why he did not
go into the Church; and see who was there. I go, Sir, says
<i>William</i>, why the Ghost would frighten me out of my
Wits.--Mrs. <i>Dobbins</i> too cried, and laying hold of her
Husband said, he should not be eat up by the Ghost. A Ghost, you
Blockheads, says Mr. <span class="newpage"><a name="page49" id=
"page49">[49]</a></span><i>Long</i> in a Pet, did either of you
ever see a Ghost, or know any Body that did? Yes, says the Clerk,
my Father did once in the Shape of a Windmill, and it walked all
round the Church in a white Sheet, with Jack Boots on, and had a
Gun by its Side instead of a Sword. A fine Picture of a Ghost
truly, says Mr. <i>Long</i>, give me the Key of the Church, you
Monkey; for I tell you there is no such Thing now, whatever may
have been formerly.--Then taking the Key, he went to the Church,
all the people following him. As soon as he had opened the Door,
what Sort of a Ghost do ye think appeared? Why Little
<i>Two-Shoes</i>, who being weary, had fallen asleep in one of the
Pews during the Funeral Service, and was shut in all Night. She
immediately asked Mr. <i>Long</i> 's Pardon for the <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page50" id="page50">[50]</a></span>Trouble she
had given him, told him, she had been locked into the Church, and
said, she should not have rung the Bells, but that she was very
cold, and hearing Farmer <i>Boult</i> 's Man go whistling by with
his Horses, she was in Hopes he would have went to the Clerk for
the Key to let her out.</p>

<p><i>Containing an Account of all the Spirits,<br>
or Ghosts, she saw in the Church.</i></p>
</center>

<p>The People were ashamed to ask Little <i>Madge</i> any Questions
before Mr. <i>Long</i>, but as soon as he was gone, they all got
round her to satisfy their Curiousity, and desired she would give
them a particular Account of all that she had heard and seen.</p>

<center>
<h3>Her&nbsp; T&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;L&nbsp;&nbsp;E.</h3>
</center>

<p>I went to the Church, said she, as most of you did last Night,
to see the Burying, and being very weary, I sate me down in Mr.
<i>Jones</i>'s Pew, <span class="newpage"><a name="page52" id=
"page52">[52]</a></span>and fell fast asleep. At Eleven of the
Clock I awoke; which I believe was in some measure occasioned by
the Clock's striking, for I heard it. I started up, and could not
at first tell where I was; but after some Time I recollected the
Funeral, and soon found that I was shut in the Church. It was
dismal dark, and I could see nothing; but while I was standing in
the Pew, something jumped up upon me behind, and laid, as I
thought, its Hands over my Shoulders.----I own, I was a little
afraid at first; however, I considered that I had always been
constant at Prayers and at Church, and that I had done nobody any
Harm, but had endeavoured to do what Good I could; and then,
thought I, what have I to fear? yet I kneeled down to say my
Prayers. As soon as I was on my Knees <span class="newpage"><a
name="page53" id="page53">[53]</a></span>something very cold, as
cold as Marble, ay, as cold as Ice, touched my Neck, which made me
start; however, I continued my Prayers, and having begged
Protection from Almighty G<small>OD</small>, I found my Spirits
come, and I was sensible that I had nothing to fear; for
G<small>OD</small> Almighty protects not only all those who are
good, but also all those who endeavour to be good.----Nothing can
withstand the Power, and exceed the Goodness of G<small>OD</small>
Almighty. Armed with the Confidence of his Protection, I walked
down the Church Isle, when I heard something, pit pat, pit pat, pit
pat, come after me, and something touched my Hand, which seemed as
cold as a Marble Monument. I could not think what this was, yet I
knew it could not hurt me, and therefore I made myself easy, but
being very cold, and <span class="newpage"><a name="page54" id=
"page54">[54]</a></span>the Church being paved with Stone, which
was very damp, I felt my Way as well as I could to the Pulpit, in
doing which something brushed by me, and almost threw me down.
However I was not frightened, for I knew, that G<small>OD</small>
Almighty would suffer nothing to hurt me.</p>

<p>At last, I found out the Pulpit, and having shut too the Door, I
laid me down on the Mat and Cushion to sleep; when something thrust
and pulled the Door, as I thought for Admittance, which prevented
my going to sleep. At last it cries, <i>Bow, wow, wow</i>; and I
concluded it must be Mr. <i>Saunderson</i> 's Dog, which had
followed me from their House to Church, so I opened the Door, and
called <i>Snip, Snip</i>, and the Dog jumped up upon me
immediately. After this <i>Snip</i> and I lay down together, <span
class="newpage"><a name="page55" id="page55">[55]</a></span>and had
a most comfortable Nap; for when I awoke again it was almost light.
I then walked up and down all the Isles of the Church to keep
myself warm; and though I went into the Vault, and trod on Lady
<i>Ducklington's</i> Coffin, I saw no Ghost, and I believe it was
owing to the Reason Mr. <i>Long</i> has given you, namely, that
there is no such Thing to be seen. As to my Part, I would as soon
lie all Night in the Church as in any other Place; and I am sure
that any little Boy or Girl, who is good, and loves
G<small>OD</small> Almighty, and keeps his Commandments, may as
safely lie in the Church, or the Church-yard, as any where else, if
they take Care not to get Cold; for I am sure there are no Ghosts,
either to hurt, or to frighten them; though any one possessed of
Fear <span class="newpage"><a name="page56" id=
"page56">[56]</a></span>might have taken Neighbour
<i>Saunderson</i> 's Dog with his cold Nose for a Ghost; and if
they had not been undeceived, as I was, would never have thought
otherwise. All the Company acknowledged the Justness of the
Observation, and thanked Little <i>Two-Shoes</i> for her
Advice.</p>

<br>
<p>After this, my dear Children, I hope you will not believe any
foolish Stories that ignorant, weak, or designing People may tell
you about <i>Ghosts</i>; for the Tales of <i>Ghosts</i>,
<i>Witches</i>, and <i>Fairies</i>, are the Frolicks of a
distempered Brain. No wise Man ever saw either of them. Little
<i>Margery</i> you see was not afraid; no, she had <i>good
Sense</i>, and a <i>good Conscience</i>, which is a Cure for all
these imaginary Evils.</p>

<h3>C&nbsp;&nbsp;H&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;P.
&nbsp;&nbsp;VIII.</h3>

<p><i>Of something which happened to Little</i> Two-Shoes<br>
<i>in a Barn, more dreadful than the Ghost in the Church;<br>
and how she returned Good for Evil to her Enemy Sir</i>
Timothy.</p>
</center>

<img src="images/image18.png" width="336" height="293" alt=
"Farmer's Barn" border="0" align="right">

<p>Some Days after this a more dreadful Accident befel Little
<i>Madge</i>. She happened to be coming late from teaching, when it
rained, thundered, and lightened, and therefore she took Shelter in
a Farmer's Barn <span class="newpage"><a name="page58" id=
"page58">[58]</a></span>at a Distance from the Village. Soon after,
the Tempest drove in four Thieves, who, not seeing such a little
creep-mouse Girl as <i>Two-Shoes</i>, lay down on the Hay next to
her, and began to talk over their Exploits, and to settle Plans for
future Robberies. Little <i>Margery</i> on hearing them, covered
herself with Straw. To be sure she was sadly frighted, but her good
<span class="newpage"><a name="page59" id=
"page59">[59]</a></span>Sense taught her, that the only Security
she had was in keeping herself concealed; therefore she laid very
still, and breathed very softly. About Four o'Clock these wicked
People came to a Resolution to break both Sir <i>William Dove's</i>
House, and Sir <i>Timothy Gripe's</i>, and by Force of Arms to
carry off all their Money, Plate and Jewels; but as it was thought
then too late, they agreed to defer it till the next Night. After
laying this Scheme they all set out upon their Pranks, which
greatly rejoiced <i>Margery</i>, as it would any other little Girl
in her Situation. Early in the Morning she went to Sir
<i>William</i>, and told him the whole of their Conversation. Upon
which, he asked her Name, gave her Something, and bid her call at
his House the Day following. She also went to Sir <i>Timothy</i>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page60" id=
"page60">[60]</a></span>notwithstanding he had used her so ill; for
she knew it was her Duty to <i>do Good for Evil</i>. As soon as he
was informed who she was, he took no Notice of her; upon which she
desired to speak to Lady <i>Gripe</i>; and having informed her
Ladyship of the Affair, she went her Way. This Lady had more Sense
than her Husband, which indeed is not a singular Case; for instead
of despising Little <i>Margery</i> and her Information, she
privately set People to guard the House. The Robbers divided
themselves, and went about the Time mentioned to both Houses, and
were surprized by the Guards, and taken. Upon examining these
Wretches, one of which turned Evidence, both Sir <i>William</i> and
Sir <i>Timothy</i> found that they owed their Lives to the
Discovery made by Little <i>Margery</i>, and the first took <span
class="newpage"><a name="page61" id="page61">[61]</a></span>great
Notice of her, and would no longer let her lie in a Barn; but Sir
<i>Timothy</i> only said, that he was ashamed to owe his Life to
the Daughter of one who was his Enemy; so true it is, <i>that a
proud Man seldom forgives those he has injured</i>.</p>

<br>

<h3>C&nbsp;&nbsp;H&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;P. &nbsp;&nbsp;IX.</h3>

<p><i>How Little</i> Margery <i>was made Principal of a Country
College.</i></p>
</center>

<p>Mrs. <i>Williams</i>, of whom I have given a particular Account
in my <i>New Year's Gift</i>, and who kept a College for
instructing little Gentlemen and Ladies in the Science of A, B, C,
was at this Time very old and infirm, and wanted to decline that
important Trust. This being told to Sir <i>William Dove</i>, who
lived <span class="newpage"><a name="page62" id=
"page62">[62]</a></span>in the Parish, he sent for Mrs.
<i>Williams</i>, and desired she would examine Little
<i>Two-Shoes</i>, and see whether she was qualified for the
Office.----This was done, and Mrs. <i>Williams</i> made the
following Report in her Favour, namely, <i>that Little</i> Margery
<i>was the best Scholar, and had the best Head, and the best Heart
of any one she had examined</i>. All the Country had a great
Opinion of Mrs. <i>Williams</i>, and this Character gave them also
a great Opinion of Mrs. <i>Margery</i>; for so we must now call
her.</p>

<p>This Mrs. <i>Margery</i> thought the happiest Period of her
Life; but more Happiness was in Store for her. G<small>OD</small>
Almighty heaps up Blessings for all those who love him, and though
for a Time he may suffer them to be poor and distressed, and hide
his good Purposes from human Sight, yet in <span class="newpage"><a
name="page63" id="page63">[63]</a></span>the End they are generally
crowned with Happiness here, and no one can doubt of their being so
hereafter.</p>

<p>On this Occasion the following Hymn, or rather a Translation of
the twenty-third Psalm, is said to have been written, and was soon
after published in the <i>Spectator</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord my Pasture shall prepare,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And feed me with a Shepherd's Care:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His Presence shall my Wants supply,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And guard me with a watchful Eye;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My Noon-day Walks he shall attend,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all my Midnight Hours defend.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;II.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When in the sultry Glebe I faint,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or on the thirsty Mountain pant;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To fertile Vales and dewy Meads,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My weary wand'ring Steps he leads;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where peaceful Rivers, soft and slow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the verdant Landskip flow.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;III.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page64" id="page64">[64]</a></span>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho' in the Paths of Death I tread,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With gloomy Horrors overspread,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My stedfast Heart shall fear no ill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For thou, O Lord, art with me still;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy friendly Crook shall give me Aid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And guide me thro' the dreadful Shade.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;IV.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho' in a bare and rugged Way,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thro' devious lonely Wilds I stray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy Bounty shall my Pains beguile:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The barren Wilderness shall smile,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With sudden Greens &amp; herbage crown'd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Streams shall murmur all around.</p>

<p>Here ends the History of Little <i>Two Shoes</i>. Those who
would know how she behaved after she came to be Mrs. <i>Margery
Two-Shoes</i> must read the Second Part of this Work, in which an
Account of the Remainder of her Life, her Marriage, and Death are

<p>In the first Part of this Work, the young Student has read, and
I hope with Pleasure and Improvement, the History of this Lady,
while she was known and distinguished by the Name of <i>Little
Two-Shoes</i>; we are now come to a Period of her Life when that
Name was discarded, and a more eminent one bestowed upon her, <span
class="newpage"><a name="page66" id="page66">[66]</a></span>I mean
that of Mrs. <i>Margery Two-Shoes</i>: For as she was now President
of the A, B, C College, it became necessary to exalt her in Title
as well as in Place.</p>

<p>No sooner was she settled in this Office, but she laid every
possible Scheme to promote the Welfare and Happiness of all her
Neighbours, and especially of the Little Ones, in whom she took
great Delight, and all those whose Parents could not afford to pay
for their Education, she taught for nothing, but the Pleasure she
had in their Company, for you are to observe, that they were very
good, or were soon made so by her good Management.</p>

<h3>C&nbsp;&nbsp;H&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;P. &nbsp;&nbsp;I.</h3>

<p><i>Of her School, her Ushers, or Assistants, and her Manner of
Teaching.</i></p>
</center>

<p>We have already informed the Reader, that the School where she
taught, was that which was before kept by Mrs. <i>Williams</i>,
whose Character you may find in my <i>New Year's Gift</i>. The Room
was large, and as she knew, that Nature intended Children should be
always in Action, she placed her different Letters, or Alphabets,
all round the School, so that every one was obliged to get up to
fetch a Letter, or to spell a Word, when it came to their Turn;
which not only kept them in Health, but fixed the Letters and
Points firmly in their Minds.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page68" id="page68">[68]</a></span>

<p>She had the following Assistants or Ushers to help her, and I
will tell you how she came by them. Mrs. <i>Margery</i>, you must
know, was very humane and compassionate; and her Tenderness
extended not only to all Mankind, but even to all Animals that were
not noxious; as your's ought to do, if you would be happy here, and
go to Heaven hereafter. These are G<small>OD</small> Almighty's
Creatures as well as we. He made both them and us; and for wise
Purposes, best known to himself, placed them in this World to live
among us; so that they are our fellow Tenants of the Globe. How
then can People dare to torture and wantonly destroy
G<small>OD</small> Almighty's Creatures? They as well as you are
capable of feeling Pain, and of receiving Pleasure, and how can
you, who want to be made <span class="newpage"><a name="page69" id=
"page69">[69]</a></span>happy yourself, delight in making your
fellow Creatures miserable? Do you think the poor Birds, whose Nest
and young ones that wicked Boy <i>Dick Wilson</i> ran away with
Yesterday, do not feel as much Pain, as your Father and Mother
would have felt, had any one pulled down their House and ran away
with you? To be sure they do. Mrs. <i>Two-Shoes</i> used to speak
of those Things, and of naughty Boys throwing at Cocks, torturing
Flies, and whipping Horses and Dogs, with Tears in her Eyes, and
would never suffer any one to come to her School who did so.</p>

<p>One Day, as she was going through the next Village, she met with
some wicked Boys who had got a young Raven, which they were going
to throw at, she wanted to get the poor Creature out of their cruel
Hands,<span class="newpage"><a name="page70" id=
"page70">[70]</a></span> and therefore gave them a Penny for him,
and brought him home. She called his Name <i>Ralph</i>, and a fine
Bird he is. Do look at him and remember what <i>Solomon</i> says,
<i>The Eye that despiseth his Father, and regardeth not the
Distress of his Mother, the Ravens of the Valley shall peck it out,
and the young Eagles eat it.</i> Now this Bird she taught to speak,
to spell and to read; and as he was particularly fond of <span
class="newpage"><a name="page71" id="page71">[71]</a></span>playing
with the large Letters, the Children used to call this
<i>Ralph</i>'s Alphabet.</p>

<center>A&nbsp;&nbsp; B&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp; D&nbsp;&nbsp;
E&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp; G&nbsp;&nbsp; H&nbsp;&nbsp;

V&nbsp;&nbsp; W&nbsp;&nbsp; X&nbsp;&nbsp; Y&nbsp;&nbsp; Z.<br>
<br>
</center>

<p>He always sat at her Elbow, as you see in the first Picture, and
when any of the Children were wrong, she used to call out, <i>Put
them right Ralph</i>.</p>

<center><img src="images/image19.png" width="357" height="276" alt=
"Ralph the Raven" border="0"></center>

<p>Some Days after she had met with the Raven, as she was walking
in the Fields, she saw some naughty Boys, who had taken a Pidgeon,
and tied a String to its Leg, in order to let it fly, and draw it
back again when they pleased; and by this Means they tortured the
poor Animal with the Hopes of Liberty and repeated Disappointment.
This Pidgeon she also bought, and taught him how to spell and read,
though not to talk, and he performed all those <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page72" id="page72">[72]</a></span>extraordinary
Things which are recorded of the famous Bird, that was some Time
since advertised in the <i>Haymarket</i>, and visited by most of
the great People in the Kingdom. This Pidgeon was a very pretty
Fellow, and she called him <i>Tom</i>. See here he is.</p>

<center><img src="images/image20.png" width="360" height="276" alt=
"Tom the Pidgeon" border="0"></center>

<p>And as the Raven <i>Ralph</i> was fond of the large Letters,
<i>Tom</i> the Pidgeon took Care of the small ones, of which he
composed this Alphabet.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page73" id="page73">[73]</a></span>

<p>The Neighbours knowing that Mrs. <i>Two Shoes</i> was very good,
as to be sure nobody was better, made her a Present of a little
Sky-lark, and a fine Bird he is.</p>

<center><img src="images/image21.png" width="357" height="284" alt=
"Sky-lark" border="0"></center>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page74" id="page74">[74]</a></span>

<p>Now as many People, even at that Time had learned to lie in Bed
long in the Morning, she thought the Lark might be of Use to her
and her Pupils, and tell them when to get up.</p>

<p><i>For be that is fond of his Bed, and lays 'till Noon, lives
but half his Days, the rest being lost in Sleep, which is a Kind of
Death</i>.</p>

<p>Some Time after this a poor Lamb had lost its Dam, and the
Farmer being about to kill it, she bought it of him, and brought it
home with her to play with the Children, and teach them when to go
to Bed; for it was a Rule with the wise Men of that Age (and a very
good one, let me tell you) to</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page75" id="page75">[75]</a></span>

<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise with the Lark, and lie down with the
Lamb.</i></p>

<p>This Lamb she called <i>Will</i>, and a pretty Fellow he is; do,
look at him.</p>

<center><img src="images/image22.png" width="368" height="297" alt=
"Will the Lamb" border="0"></center>

<p>No sooner was <i>Tippy</i> the Lark and <i>Will</i> the Ba-lamb
brought into the School, but that sensible Rogue <i>Ralph</i>, the
Raven, composed the <span class="newpage"><a name="page76" id=
"page76">[76]</a></span>following Verse, which every little good
Boy and Girl should get by Heart.</p>

<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Early to Bed, and early to rise;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Way to be healthy, and wealthy, and
wise</i>.</p>

<p>A sly Rogue; but it is true enough; for those who do not go to
Bed early cannot rise early; and those who do not rise early cannot
do much Business. Pray, let this be told at the Court, and to
People who have Routs and Rackets.</p>

<p>Soon after this, a Present was made to Mrs. <i>Margery</i> of
little Dog <i>Jumper</i>, and a pretty Dog he is. Pray, look at
him.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page77" id="page77">[77]</a></span>

<center><img src="images/image23.png" width="339" height="287" alt=
"Jumper the Dog" border="0"></center>

<p><i>Jumper, Jumper, Jumper!</i> He is always in a good Humour,
and playing and jumping about, and therefore he was called
<i>Jumper</i>. The Place assigned for <i>Jumper</i> was that of
keeping the Door, so that he may be called the Porter of the
College, for he would let nobody go out, or any one come in,
without the Leave of his Mistress. See how he sits, a saucy
Rogue.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page78" id="page78">[78]</a></span>

<p><i>Billy</i> the Ba-lamb was a chearful Fellow, and all the
Children were fond of him, wherefore Mrs. <i>Two-Shoes</i> made it
a Rule, that those who behaved best should have <i>Will</i> home
with them at Night to carry their Satchel or Basket at his Back,
and bring it in the Morning. See what a fine Fellow he is, and how
he trudges along.</p>

<p><i>A Scene of Distress in the School</i>.</p>
</center>

<img src="images/image24.png" width="277" height="218" alt=
"the Pidgeon rode on the his head" border="0" align="left">

<p>It happened one Day, when Mrs. <i>Two-Shoes</i> was diverting
the Children after Dinner, as she usually did with some innocent
Games, or entertaining and instructive Stories, that a Man arrived
with the melancholy News of <i>Sally Jones's</i> Father being <span
class="newpage"><a name="page79" id="page79">[79]</a></span>thrown
from his Horse, and thought past all Recovery; nay, the Messenger
said, that he was seemingly dying, when he came away. Poor
<i>Sally</i> was greatly distressed, as indeed were all the School,
for she dearly loved her Father, and Mrs. <i>Two-Shoes</i>, and all
the Children dearly loved her. It is generally said, that we never
know the real Value of our Parents or Friends till we have lost
them; but poor <i>Sally</i> felt this by Affection, and her
Mistress knew it by Experience. All the School were in Tears, and
the Messenger was obliged to return; but before he went, Mrs.
<i>Two-Shoes</i>, unknown to the Children, ordered <i>Tom</i>
Pidgeon to go home with the Man, and bring a Letter to inform her
how Mr. <i>Jones</i> did. They set out together, <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page80" id="page80">[80]</a></span>and the
Pidgeon rode on the Man's Head, (as you see here) for the Man was
able to carry the Pidgeon, though the Pidgeon was not able to carry
the Man, if he had, they would have been there much sooner, for
<i>Tom</i> Pidgeon was <i>very good</i>, and never staid on an
Errand.</p>

<p>Soon after the Man was gone the <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page81" id="page81">[81]</a></span>Pidgeon was lost, and the
Concern the Children were under for Mr. <i>Jones</i> and little
<i>Sally</i> was in some Measure diverted, and Part of their
Attention turned after <i>Tom</i>, who was a great Favourite, and
consequently much bewailed. Mrs. <i>Margery</i>, who knew the great
Use and Necessity of teaching Children to submit chearfully to the
Will of Providence, bid them wipe away their Tears, and then
kissing <i>Sally</i>, you must be a good Girl, says she, and depend
upon G<small>OD</small> Almighty for his Blessing and Protection;
for <i>he is a Father to the Fatherless, and defendeth all those
who put their Trust in him</i>. She then told them a Story, which I
shall relate in as few Words as possible.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page82" id="page82">[82]</a></span>

<center>
<p><i>The History of Mr.</i> Lovewell, <i>Father to Lady</i>
Lucy.</p>
</center>

<p>Mr. <i>Lovewell</i> was born at <i>Bath</i>, and apprenticed to
a laborious Trade in <i>London</i>, which being too hard for him,
he parted with his Master by Consent, and hired himself as a common
Servant to a Merchant in the City. Here he spent his leisure Hours
not as Servants too frequently do, in Drinking and Schemes of
Pleasure, but in improving his Mind; and among other Acquirements,
he made himself a complete Master of Accompts. His Sobriety,
Honesty, and the Regard he paid to his Master's Interest, greatly
recommended him in the whole Family, and he had several Offices of
Trust committed to his Charge, in which he <span class="newpage"><a
name="page83" id="page83">[83]</a></span>acquitted himself so well,
that the Merchant removed him from the Stable into the
Counting-house.</p>

<p>Here he soon made himself Master of the Business, and became so
useful to the Merchant, that in regard to his faithful Services,
and the Affection he had for him, he married him to his own Niece,
a prudent agreeable young Lady; and gave him a Share in the
Business. See what Honesty and Industry will do for us. Half the
great Men in <i>London</i>, I am told, have made themselves by this
Means, and who would but be honest and industrious, when it is so
much our Interest and our Duty.</p>

<p>After some Years the Merchant died, and left Mr. <i>Lovewell</i>
possessed of many fine Ships at Sea, and much Money, and he was
happy in a Wife, who had brought him a Son and two <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page84" id="page84">[84]</a></span>Daughters,
all dutiful and obedient. The Treasures and good Things, however,
of this Life are so uncertain, that a Man can never be happy,
unless he lays the Foundation for it in his own Mind. So true is
that Copy in our Writing Books, which tells us, that <i>a contented
Mind is a continual Feast</i>.</p>

<p>After some Years successful Trade, he thought his Circumstances
sufficient to insure his own Ships, or, in other Words, to send his
Ships and Goods to Sea without being insured by others, as is
customary among Merchants; when, unfortunately for him, four of
them richly laden were lost at Sea. This he supported with becoming
Resolution; but the next Mail brought him Advice, that nine others
were taken by the <i>French</i>, with whom we were then at War; and
this, <span class="newpage"><a name="page85" id=
"page85">[85]</a></span>together with the Failure of three foreign
Merchants whom he had trusted, compleated his Ruin. He was then
obliged to call his Creditors together, who took his Effects, and
being angry with him for the imprudent Step of not insuring his
Ships, left him destitute of all Subsistence. Nor did the
Flatterers of his Fortune, those who had lived by his Bounty when
in his Prosperity, pay the least Regard either to him or his
Family. So true is another Copy, that you will find in your Writing
Book, which says, <i>Misfortune tries our Friends</i>. All these
Slights of his pretended Friends, and the ill Usage of his
Creditors, both he and his Family bore with Christian Fortitude;
but other Calamities fell upon him, which he felt more
sensibly.</p>

<p>In his Distress, one of his <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page86" id="page86">[86]</a></span>Relations, who lived at
<i>Florence</i>, offered to take his Son; and another, who lived at
<i>Barbadoes</i>, sent for one of his Daughters. The Ship which his
Son sailed in was cast away, and all the Crew supposed to be lost;
and the Ship, in which his Daughter went a Passenger, was taken by
Pyrates, and one Post brought the miserable Father an Account of
the Loss of his two Children. This was the severest Stroke of all:
It made him compleatly wretched, and he knew it must have a
dreadful Effect on his Wife and Daughter; he therefore endeavoured
to conceal it from them. But the perpetual Anxiety he was in,
together with the Loss of his Appetite and Want of Rest, soon
alarmed his Wife. She found something was labouring in his Breast,
which was concealed from her; and one <span class="newpage"><a
name="page87" id="page87">[87]</a></span>Night being disturbed in a
Dream, with what was ever in his Thoughts, and calling out upon his
dear Children; she awoke him, and insisted upon knowing the Cause
of his Inquietude. <i>Nothing, my Dear, nothing,</i> says he,
<i>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the Name
of the Lord.</i> This was sufficient to alarm the poor Woman; she
lay till his Spirits were composed, and as she thought asleep, then
stealing out of Bed, got the Keys and opened his Bureau, where she
found the fatal Account. In the Height of her Distractions, she
flew to her Daughter's Room, and waking her with her Shrieks, put
the Letters into her Hands. The young Lady, unable to support this
Load of Misery, fell into a Fit, from which it was thought she
never could have been recovered. <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page88" id="page88">[88]</a></span>However, at last she revived;
but the Shock was so great, that it entirely deprived her of her
Speech.</p>

<p>Thus loaded with Misery, and unable to bear the Slights and
Disdain of those who had formerly professed themselves Friends,
this unhappy Family retired into a Country, where they were
unknown, in order to hide themselves from the World; when, to
support their Independency, the Father laboured as well as he could
at Husbandry, and the Mother and Daughter sometimes got spinning
and knitting Work, to help to furnish the Means of Subsistence;
which however was so precarious and uncertain, that they often, for
many Weeks together, lived on nothing but Cabbage and Bread boiled
in Water. But G<small>OD</small> never forsaketh the Righteous, nor
suffereth those to <span class="newpage"><a name="page89" id=
"page89">[89]</a></span>perish who put their Trust in him. At this
Time a Lady, who was just come to England, sent to take a pleasant
Seat ready furnished in that Neighbourhood, and the Person who was
employed for the Purpose, was ordered to deliver a Bank Note of an
hundred Pounds to Mr. <i>Lovewell</i>, another hundred to his Wife,
and fifty to the Daughter, desiring them to take Possession of the
House, and get it well aired against she came down, which would be
in two or three Days at most. This, to People who were almost
starving, was a sweet and seasonable Relief, and they were all
sollicitous to know their Benefactress, but of that the Messenger
himself was too ignorant to inform them. However, she came down
sooner than was expected, and with Tears embraced them again and
<span class="newpage"><a name="page90" id=
"page90">[90]</a></span>again: After which she told the Father and
Mother she had heard from their Daughter, who was her Acquaintance,
and that she was well and on her Return to England. This was the
agreeable Subject of their Conversation till after Dinner, when
drinking their Healths, she again with Tears saluted them, and
falling upon her Knees asked their Blessings.</p>

<center><img src="images/image25.png" width="356" height="273" alt=
"falling upon her Knees and asked their blessings" border=
"0"></center>

<p>Tis impossible to express the mutual <span class="newpage"><a
name="page91" id="page91">[91]</a></span>Joy which this occasioned.
Their Conversation was made up of the most endearing Expressions,
intermingled with Tears and Caresses. Their Torrent of Joy,
however, was for a Moment interrupted, by a Chariot which stopped
at the Gate, and which brought as they thought a very unseasonable
Visitor, and therefore she sent to be excused from seeing
Company.</p>

<img src="images/image26.png" width="363" height="278" alt=
"Chariot" border="0" align="left"> <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page92" id="page92">[92]</a></span>

<p>But this had no Effect, for a Gentleman richly dressed jumped
out of the Chariot, and pursuing the Servant into the Parlour
saluted them round, who were all astonished at his Behaviour. But
when the Tears trickled from his Cheeks, the Daughter, who had been
some Years dumb, immediately cried out, <i>my Brother! my Brother!
my Brother!</i> and from that Instant recovered her Speech. The
mutual Joy which this occasioned, is better felt than expressed.
Those who have proper Sentiments of Humanity, Gratitude, and filial
Piety will rejoice at the Event, and those who have a proper Idea
of the Goodness of G<small>OD</small>, and his gracious Providence,
will from this, as well as other Instances of his Goodness and
Mercy, glorify his holy Name, and magnify his Wisdom and Power, who
is a <span class="newpage"><a name="page93" id=
"page93">[93]</a></span>Shield to the Righteous, and defendeth all
those who put their Trust in him.</p>

<p>As you, my dear Children, may be sollicitous to know how this
happy Event was brought about, I must inform you, that Mr.
<i>Lovewell</i> 's Son, when the Ship foundered, had with some
others got into the long Boat, and was taken up by a Ship at Sea,
and carried to the East Indies, where in a little Time he made a
large Fortune; and the Pirates who took his Daughter, attempted to
rob her of her Chastity; but finding her Inflexible, and determined
to die rather than to submit, some of them behaved to her in a very
cruel Manner; but others, who had more Honour and Generosity,
became her Defenders; upon which a Quarrel arose between them, and
the Captain, who was the worst <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page94" id="page94">[94]</a></span>of the Gang, being killed, the
rest of the Crew carried the Ship into a Port of the <i>Manilla</i>
Islands, belonging to the <i>Spaniards</i>; where, when her Story
was known, she was treated with great Respect, and courted by a
young Gentleman, who was taken ill of a Fever, and died before the
Marriage was agreed on, but left her his whole Fortune.</p>

<p>You see, my dear <i>Sally</i>, how wonderfully these People were
preserved, and made happy after such extreme Distress; we are
therefore never to despair, even under the greatest Misfortunes,
for G<small>OD</small> Almighty is All-powerful and can deliver us
at any Time. Remember <i>Job</i>, but I think you have not read so
far, take the Bible, <i>Billy Jones</i>, and read the History of
that good and patient Man. At this Instant something was heard to
<span class="newpage"><a name="page95" id=
"page95">[95]</a></span>flap at the Window, <i>Wow, wow, wow</i>,
says Jumper, and attempted to leap up and open the Door, at which
the Children were surprized; but Mrs. <i>Margery</i> knowing what
it was, opened the Casement, as <i>Noah</i> did the Window of the
Ark, and drew in <i>Tom</i> Pidgeon with a Letter, and see here he
is.</p>

<center><img src="images/image27.png" width="353" height="276" alt=
"Tom Pidgeon with a Letter" border="0"></center>

<p>As soon as he was placed on the Table, he walked up to little
<i>Sally</i>, <span class="newpage"><a name="page96" id=
"page96">[96]</a></span>and dropping the Letter, cried, <i>Co, Co,
Coo</i>, as much as to say, <i>there read it</i>. Now this poor
Pidgeon had travelled fifty Miles in about an Hour, to bring
<i>Sally</i> this Letter, and who would destroy such pretty
Creatures.----But let us read the Letter.</p>

<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear</i> Sally,</p>

G<small>OD</small> Almighty has been very merciful, and restored
your Pappa to us again, who is now so well as to be able to sit up.
I hear you are a good Girl, my Dear, and I hope you will never
forget to praise the Lord for this his great Goodness and Mercy to
us--What a sad Thing it would have been if your Father had died,
and left both you and me, and little <i>Tommy</i> in Distress, and
without a Friend: Your Father sends his Blessing <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page97" id="page97">[97]</a></span>with mine--Be
good, my dear Child, and G<small>OD</small> Almighty will also
bless you, whose Blessing is above all Things.<br>
<br>
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, my Dear Sally</i>,</p>

<p><i>Of the amazing Sagacity and Instincts of a little
Dog</i>.</p>
</center>

<p>Soon after this, a dreadful Accident happened in the School. It
was on a <i>Thursday</i> Morning, I very well remember, when the
Children having learned their Lessons soon, she had given them
Leave to <span class="newpage"><a name="page98" id=
"page98">[98]</a></span>play, and they were all running about the
School, and diverting themselves with the Birds and the Lamb; at
this Time the Dog, all of a sudden, laid hold of his Mistress's
Apron, and endeavoured to pull her out of the School. She was at
first surprized, however, she followed him to see what he intended.
No sooner had he led her into the Garden, but he ran back, and
pulled out one of the Children in the same manner; upon which she
ordered them all to leave the School immediately, and they had not
been out five Minutes, before the Top of the House fell in. What a
miraculous Deliverance was here! How gracious! How good was
G<small>OD</small> Almighty, to save all these Children from
Destruction, and to make Use of such an Instrument, as a little
sagacious Animal to accomplish <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page99" id="page99">[99]</a></span>his Divine Will. I should have
observed, that as soon as they were all in the Garden, the Dog came
leaping round them to express his Joy, and when the House was
fallen, laid himself down quietly by his Mistress.</p>

<p>Some of the Neighbours, who saw the School fall, and who were in
great Pain for <i>Margery</i> and the little ones, soon spread the
News through the Village, and all the Parents, terrified for their
Children, came crowding in Abundance; they had, however, the
Satisfaction to find them all safe, and upon their Knees, with
their Mistress, giving G<small>OD</small> thanks for their happy
Deliverance.</p>

<i>Jumper</i>, they would guard against Accidents of this Sort, by
having a public Survey, occasionally made of all the Houses in
every Parish (especially of those, which are old and decayed) and
not suffer them to remain in a crazy State, 'till they fall down on
the Heads of the poor Inhabitants, and crush them to Death. Why, it
was but Yesterday, that a whole House fell down in
<i>Grace-church-street</i>, and another in <i>Queen's-street</i>,
and an hundred more are to tumble, before this Time twelve Months;
so Friends, take Care of yourselves, and tell the Legislature, they
ought to take Care for you. How can you be so careless? Most of
your Evils arise from Carelesness and Extravagance, and yet you
excuse yourselves, and lay the Fault <span class="newpage"><a name=

<p>Though G<small>OD</small> Almighty has made Man the Lord of the
Creation, and endowed him with Reason, yet in many Respects, he has
been altogether as bountiful to other Creatures of his forming.
Some of the Senses of other Animals are more acute than ours, as we
find by daily Experience. You know this little Bird, <span class=

Jug, Jug, Jug</i>, 'tis a Nightingale. This little Creature, after
she has entertained us with her Songs all the Spring, and bred up
her little ones, flies into a foreign Country, and finds her Way
over the Great Sea, without any of the Instruments and Helps which

<p>You would not think <i>Ralph</i> the Raven half so wise and so
good as he is, though you see him here reading his book. Yet when
the Prophet <i>Elijah</i>, was obliged to fly from <i>Ahab</i> King
of <i>Israel</i>, and hide himself in a Cave, the Ravens, at the
Command of G<small>OD</small> Almighty, fed him every Day, and
preserved his Life.</p>

<p><i>And the Word of the Lord came unto</i> Elijah<i>, saying,
Hide thyself by the Brook</i> Cherith<i>, that is before</i>
Jordan<i>, and I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there. And
the Ravens brought him Bread and Flesh in the Morning, and Bread
and Flesh in the Evening, and he drank of the Brook,</i> Kings,

<p>And the pretty Pidgeon when the <span class="newpage"><a name=

was confined with <i>Noah</i> in the Ark, was sent forth by him to
see whether the Waters were abated, <i>And he sent forth a Dove
from him, to see if the Waters were abated from off the Face of the
Ground. And the Dove came in to him in the Evening, and lo, in her
Mouth was an Olive Leaf plucked off: So</i> Noah <i>knew that the
Waters were abated from off the Earth.</i> Gen. viii. 8. 11.</p>

ought to be tender and good to them, and not beat them about, and
kill them, and take away their young ones, as many wicked Boys do.

<p>The downfal of the School, was a great Misfortune to Mrs.
<i>Margery</i>; for she not only lost all her Books, but was
destitute of a Place to teach in; but Sir William <i>Dove</i>,
being informed of this, ordered the House to be built at his own
Expence, and <span class="newpage"><a name="page106" id=
"page106">[106]</a></span>'till that could be done, Farmer
<i>Grove</i> was so kind, as to let her have his large Hall to
teach in.</p>

The House built by Sir <i>William</i>, had a Statue erected over
the Door of a Boy sliding on the Ice, and under it were these
Lines, written by Mrs. <i>Two-Shoes</i>, and engraved at her
Expence.<br>

<h3>C&nbsp;&nbsp;H&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;P. &nbsp;&nbsp;IV.</h3>

<p><i>What happened at Farmer Grove's; and how<br>
she gratified him for the Use of his Room</i>.</p>
</center>

<p>While at Mr. <i>Grove's</i>, which was in the Heart of the
Village, she not only taught the Children in the Day Time, but the
Farmer's Servants, and all the Neighbours, to read and write in the
Evening; and it was a constant Practice before they went away, to
make them all go to Prayers, and sing Psalms. By this Means, the
People grew extremely regular, his Servants were always at Home,
instead of being at the Ale-house, and he had more Work done than
ever. This <span class="newpage"><a name="page109" id=
"page109">[109]</a></span>gave not only Mr. <i>Grove</i>, but all
the Neighbours, an high Opinion of her good Sense and prudent
Behaviour: And she was so much esteemed, that most of the
Differences in the Parish were left to her Decision; and if a Man
and Wife quarrelled (which sometimes happened in that Part of the
Kingdom) both Parties certainly came to her for Advice. Every Body
knows, that <i>Martha Wilson</i> was a passionate scolding Jade,
and that <i>John</i> her husband, was a surly ill-tempered Fellow.
These were one Day brought by the Neighbours for <i>Margery</i> to
talk to them, when they fairly quarrelled before her, and were
going to Blows; but she stepping between them, thus addressed the
Husband; <i>John</i>, says she, you are a Man, and ought to have
more Sense than to fly <span class="newpage"><a name="page110" id=
"page110">[110]</a></span>in a Passion, at every Word that is said
amiss by your Wife; and <i>Martha</i>, says she, you ought to know
your Duty better, than to say any Thing to aggravate your Husband's
Resentment. These frequent Quarrels, arise from the Indulgence of
your violent Passions; for I know, you both love one another,
notwithstanding what has passed between you. Now, pray tell me
<i>John</i>, and tell me <i>Martha</i>, when you have had a Quarrel
the over Night, are you not both sorry for it the next Day? They
both declared that they were: Why then, says she, I'll tell you how
to prevent this for the future, if you will both promise to take my
Advice. They both promised her. You know, says she, that a small
Spark will set Fire to Tinder, and that Tinder <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page111" id="page111">[111]</a></span>properly
placed will fire a House; an angry Word is with you as that Spark,
for you are both as touchy as Tinder, and very often make your own
House too hot to hold you. To prevent this, therefore, and to live
happily for the future, you must solemnly agree, that if one speaks
an angry Word, the other will not answer, 'till he or she has
distinctly called over all the Letters in the Alphabet, and the
other not reply, 'till he has told twenty; by this Means your
Passions will be stifled, and Reason will have Time to take the
Rule.</p>

<p>This is the best Recipe that was ever given for a married Couple
to live in Peace: Though <i>John</i> and his Wife frequently
attempted to quarrel afterwards, they never could get their
Passions to any considerable Height, <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page112" id="page112">[112]</a></span>for there was something so
droll in thus carrying on the Dispute, that before they got to the
End of the Argument, they saw the Absurdity of it, laughed, kissed,
and were Friends.</p>

<p>Just as Mrs. <i>Margery</i> had settled this Difference between
<i>John</i> and his Wife, the Children (who had been sent out to
play, while that Business was transacting) returned some in Tears,
and others very disconsolate, for the Loss of a little Dormouse
they were very fond of, and which was just dead. Mrs.
<i>Margery</i>, who had the Art of moralizing and drawing
Instructions from every Accident, took this Opportunity of reading
them a Lecture on the Uncertainty of Life, and the Necessity of
being always prepared for Death. You should <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page113" id="page113">[113]</a></span>get up in
the Morning, says she, and to conduct yourselves, as if that Day
was to be your last, and lie down at Night, as if you never
expected to see this World any more. This may be done, says she,
without abating of your Chearfulness, for you are not to consider
Death as an Evil, but as a Convenience, as an useful Pilot, who is
to convey you to a Place of greater Happiness: Therefore, play my
dear Children, and be merry; but be innocent and good. The good Man
sets Death at Defiance, for his Darts are only dreadful to the
Wicked.</p>

<p>After this, she permitted the Children to bury the little
Dormouse, and desired one of them to write his Epitaph, and here it
is.</p>

<h3>C&nbsp;&nbsp;H&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;P. &nbsp;&nbsp;V.</h3>

<p><i>The whole History of the Considering Cap, set forth<br>
at large for the Benefit of all whom it may concern</i>.</p>
</center>

<img src="images/image30.png" width="292" height="230" alt=
"Considering Cap" border="0" align="left">

<p>The great Reputation Mrs. <i>Margery</i> acquired by composing
Differences in Families, and especially, between Man and Wife,
induced her to cultivate that Part of her System of Morality and
Economy, in order to render it more extensively useful. For this
Purpose, she contrived what she called a Charm for the Passions;
which was a considering Cap, almost as large as a Grenadier's, but
of three equal Sides; on the first of which was written, I&nbsp;
<small>M&nbsp;A&nbsp;Y&nbsp; B&nbsp;E&nbsp;
W&nbsp;R&nbsp;O&nbsp;N&nbsp;G&nbsp;</small> ; on the second,
I&nbsp;<small>T&nbsp; I&nbsp;S&nbsp;
F&nbsp;I&nbsp;F&nbsp;T&nbsp;Y&nbsp; T&nbsp;O&nbsp;
O&nbsp;N&nbsp;E&nbsp; B&nbsp;U&nbsp;T&nbsp; Y&nbsp;O&nbsp;U&nbsp;
A&nbsp;R&nbsp;E&nbsp;;</small> <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page116" id="page116">[116]</a></span>and on the third,
I'<small>&nbsp;L&nbsp;L&nbsp;
C&nbsp;O&nbsp;N&nbsp;S&nbsp;I&nbsp;D&nbsp;E&nbsp;R&nbsp;
O&nbsp;F&nbsp; I&nbsp;T&nbsp;</small> . The other Parts on the
out-side, were filled with odd Characters, as unintelligible as the
Writings of the old <i>Egyptians</i>; but within Side there was a
Direction for its Use, of the utmost Consequence; for it strictly
enjoined the Possessor to put on the Cap, whenever he found his
Passions begin to grow turbulent, and not to <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page117" id="page117">[117]</a></span>deliver a
Word whilst it was on, but with great Coolness and Moderation. As
this Cap was an universal Cure for Wrong-headedness, and prevented
numberless Disputes and Quarrels, it greatly hurt the Trade of the
poor Lawyers, but was of the utmost Service to the rest of the
Community. They were bought by Husbands and Wives, who had
themselves frequent Occasion for them, and sometimes lent them to
their Children: They were also purchased in large Quantities by
Masters and Servants; by young Folks, who were intent on Matrimony,
by Judges, Jurymen, and even Physicians and Divines; nay, if we may
believe History, the Legislators of the Land did not disdain the
Use of them; and we are told, that when any important Debate arose,
<i>Cap, was the Word</i>, and <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page118" id="page118">[118]</a></span>each House looked like a
grand Synod of <i>Egyptian</i> Priests. Nor was this Cap of less
Use to Partners in Trade, for with these, as well as with Husband
and Wife, if one was out of Humour, the other threw him the Cap,
and he was obliged to put it on, and keep it till all was quiet. I
myself saw thirteen Caps worn at a Time in one Family, which could
not have subsisted an Hour without them; and I was particularly
pleased at Sir <i>Humphry Huffum's</i>, to hear a little Girl, when
her Father was out of Humour, ask her Mamma, <i>if she should reach
down the Cap</i> ? These Caps, indeed, were of such Utility, that
People of Sense never went without them; and it was common in the
Country, when a Booby made his Appearance, and talked Nonsense, to
say, <i>he had no Cap in his Pocket</i>.</p>

<p>What was <i>Fortunatus</i> 's Wishing Cap, when compared to
this? That Cap, is said to have conveyed People instantly from one
Place to another; but, as the Change of Place does not change the
Temper and Disposition of the Mind, little Benefit can be expected
from it; nor indeed is much <span class="newpage"><a name="page120"
id="page120">[120]</a></span>to be hoped from his famous Purse:
That Purse, it is said, was never empty, and such a Purse, may be
sometimes convenient; but as Money will not purchase Peace, it is
not necessary for a Man to encumber himself with a great deal of
it. Peace and Happiness depend so much upon the State of a Man's
own Mind, and upon the Use of the considering Cap, that it is
generally his own Fault, if he is miserable. One of these Caps will
last a Man his whole Life, and is a Discovery of much greater
Importance to the Public than the Philosopher's Stone. Remember
what was said by my Brazen Head, <i>Time is, Time was, Time is
past</i>: Now the <i>Time is</i>, therefore buy the Cap
immediately, and make a proper Use of it, and be happy before the
<i>Time is past</i>.</p>

<h3>C&nbsp;&nbsp;H&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;P. &nbsp;&nbsp;VI.</h3>

<p><i>How Mrs.</i> MARGERY <i>was taken up for a Witch,<br>
and what happened on that Occasion.</i></p>
</center>

<p>And so it is true? And they have taken up Mrs. <i>Margery</i>
then, and accused her of being a Witch, only because she was wiser
than some of her Neighbours! Mercy upon me! People stuff Children's
Heads with Stories of Ghosts, Faries, Witches, and such Nonsense
when they are young, and so they continue Fools all their Days. The
whole World ought to be made acquainted with her Case, and here it
is at their Service.</p>

<center>
<p><i>The Case of Mrs.</i> MARGERY.</p>
</center>

<p>Mrs. <i>Margery</i>, as we have frequently observed, was always
doing Good, <span class="newpage"><a name="page122" id=
"page122">[122]</a></span>and thought she could never sufficiently
gratify those who had done any Thing to serve her. These generous
Sentiments, naturally led her to consult the Interest of Mr.
<i>Grove</i>, and the rest of her Neighbours; and as most of their
Lands were Meadow, and they depended much on their Hay, which had
been for many Years greatly damaged by wet Weather, she contrived
an Instrument to direct them when to mow their Grass with Safety,
and prevent their Hay being spoiled. They all came to her for
Advice, and by that Means got in their Hay without Damage, while
most of that in the neighbouring Villages was spoiled.</p>

<img src="images/image32.png" width="278" height="223" alt=
"a Witch!" border="0" align="right">

<p>This made a great Noise in the Country, and so provoked were the
People in the other Parishes, that they accused her of being a
Witch, and <span class="newpage"><a name="page123" id=
"page123">[123]</a></span>sent Gaffer <i>Goosecap</i>, a busy
Fellow in other People's Concerns, to find out Evidence against
her. This Wiseacre happened to come to her School, when she was
walking about with the Raven on one Shoulder, the Pidgeon on the
other, the Lark on her Hand, and the Lamb and the Dog by her Side;
which indeed made a droll Figure, and so surprized the that he
cried out, <span class="newpage"><a name="page124" id=
"page124">[124]</a></span>a Witch! a Witch! upon this she laughing,
answered, a Conjurer! a Conjurer! and so they parted; but it did
not end thus, for a Warrant was issued out against Mrs.
<i>Margery</i>, and she was carried to a Meeting of the Justices,
whither all the Neighbours followed her.</p>

<p>At the Meeting, one of the Justices, who knew little of Life,
and less of the Law, behaved very idly; and though no Body was able
to prove any Thing against her, asked, who she could bring to her
Character? <i>Who</i> can you bring against my Character, Sir, says
she, there are People enough who would appear in my Defence, were
it necessary; but I never supposed that any one here could be so
weak, as to believe there was any such Thing as a Witch. If I am a
Witch, this is my <span class="newpage"><a name="page125" id=
"page125">[125]</a></span>Charm, and (laying a Barometer or Weather
Glass on the Table) it is with this, says she, that I have taught
my Neighbours to know the State of the Weather. All the Company
laughed, and Sir <i>William Dove</i>, who was on the Bench, asked
her Accusers, how they could be such Fools, as to think there was
any such Thing as a Witch. It is true, continued he, many innocent
and worthy People have been abused and even murdered on this absurd
and foolish Supposition; which is a Scandal to our Religion, to our
Laws, to our Nation, and to common Sense; but I will tell you a
Story.</p>

<p>There was in the West of <i>England</i> a poor industrious
Woman, who laboured under the same evil Report, which this good
Woman is accused of. Every Hog that died with the <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page126" id="page126">[126]</a></span>Murrain,
every Cow that slipt her Calf, she was accountable for: If a Horse
had the Staggers, she was supposed to be in his Head; and whenever
the Wind blew a little harder than ordinary, <i>Goody Giles</i> was
playing her Tricks, and riding upon a Broomstick in the Air. These,
and a thousand other Phantasies, too ridiculous to recite,
possessed the Pates of the common People: Horse-shoes were nailed
with the Heels upwards, and many Tricks made use of, to mortify the
poor Creature; and such was their Rage against her, that they
petitioned Mr. <i>Williams</i>, the Parson of the Parish, not to
let her come to Church; and at last, even insisted upon it: But
this he over-ruled, and allowed the poor old Woman a Nook in one of
the Isles to herself, where she muttered over her Prayers in the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page127" id=
"page127">[127]</a></span>best Manner she could. The Parish, thus
disconcerted and enraged, withdrew the small Pittance they allowed
for her Support, and would have reduced her to the Necessity of
starving, had she not been still assisted by the benevolent Mr.
<i>Williams</i>.</p>

<p>But I hasten to the Sequel of my Story, in which you will find,
that the true Source from whence Witchcraft springs is
<i>Poverty</i>, <i>Age</i>, and <i>Ignorance</i>; and that it is
impossible for a Woman to pass for a Witch, unless she is <i>very
poor</i>, <i>very old</i>, and lives in a Neighbourhood where the
People are <i>void of common Sense</i>.</p>

<p>Some Time after, a Brother of her's died in <i>London</i>, who,
though he would not part with a Farthing while he lived, at his
Death was obliged to leave her five thousand Pounds, that he could
not carry with him.<span class="newpage"><a name="page128" id=
"page128">[128]</a></span>----This altered the Face of <i>Jane</i>
's Affairs prodigiously: She was no longer <i>Jane</i>, alias
<i>Joan Giles</i>, the ugly old Witch, but Madam <i>Giles</i>; her
old ragged Garb was exchanged for one that was new and genteel; her
greatest Enemies made their Court to her, even the Justice himself
came to wish her Joy; and though several Hogs and Horses died, and
the Wind frequently blew afterwards, yet Madam <i>Giles</i> was
never supposed to have a Hand in it; and from hence it is plain, as
I observed before, that a Woman must be <i>very poor, very old</i>,
and live in a Neighbourhood, where the People are <i>very
stupid</i>, before she can possibly pass for a Witch.</p>

<p>'Twas a Saying of Mr. <i>Williams</i>, who would sometimes be
jocose, and had the Art of making even Satire <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page129" id="page129">[129]</a></span>agreeable;
that if ever <i>Jane</i> deserved the Character of a Witch, it was
after this Money was left her; for that with her five thousand
Pounds, she did more Acts of Charity and friendly Offices, than all
the People of Fortune within fifty Miles of the Place.</p>

<p>After this, Sir <i>William</i> inveighed against the absurd and
foolish Notions, which the Country People had imbibed concerning
Witches, and Witchcraft, and having proved that there was no such
Thing, but that all were the Effects of Folly and Ignorance, he
gave the Court such an Account of Mrs. <i>Margery</i>, and her
Virtue, good Sense, and prudent Behaviour, that the Gentlemen
present were enamoured with her, and returned her public Thanks for
the great Service she had done the <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page130" id="page130">[130]</a></span>Country. One Gentleman in
particular, I mean Sir <i>Charles Jones</i>, had conceived such an
high Opinion of her, that he offered her a considerable Sum to take
the Care of his Family, and the Education of his Daughter, which,
however, she refused; but this Gentleman, sending for her
afterwards when he had a dangerous Fit of Illness, she went, and
behaved so prudently in the Family, and so tenderly to him and his
Daughter, that he would not permit her to leave his House, but soon
after made her Proposals of Marriage. She was truly sensible of the
Honour he intended her, but, though poor, she would not consent to
be made a Lady, till he had effectually provided for his Daughter;
for she told him, that Power was a dangerous Thing to be trusted
with, and that a good Man <span class="newpage"><a name="page131"
id="page131">[131]</a></span>or Woman would never throw themselves
into the Road of Temptation.</p>

<img src="images/image33.png" width="353" height="275" alt=
"the Neighbours came in Crouds to see the Wedding" border="0"
align="left">

<p>All Things being settled, and the Day fixed, the Neighbours came
in Crouds to see the Wedding; for they were all glad, that one who
had been such a good little Girl, and was become such a virtuous
and good Woman, was going to be made a Lady; but just as the
Clergyman had opened his Book, a Gentleman richly dressed <span
class="newpage"><a name="page132" id="page132">[132]</a></span>ran
into the Church, and cry'd, Stop! stop! This greatly alarmed the
Congregation, particularly the intended Bride and Bridegroom, whom
he first accosted, and desired to speak with them apart. After they
had been talking some little Time, the People were greatly
surprized to see Sir <i>Charles</i> stand Motionless, and his Bride
cry, and faint away in the Stranger's Arms. This seeming Grief,
however, was only a Prelude to a Flood of Joy, which immediately
succeeded; for you must know, gentle Reader, that this Gentleman,
so richly dressed and bedizened with Lace, was that identical
little Boy, whom you before saw in the Sailor's Habit; in short, it
was little <i>Tom Two Shoes</i>, Mrs. <i>Margery's</i> Brother, who
was just come from beyond Sea, where he had made a large Fortune,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page133" id=
"page133">[133]</a></span>and hearing, as soon as he landed, of his
Sister's intended Wedding, had rode Post, to see that a proper
Settlement was made on her; which he thought she was now intitled
to, as he himself was both able and willing to give her an ample
Fortune. They soon returned to the Communion-Table, and were
married in Tears, but they were Tears of Joy.</p>

<p>There is something wonderful in this young Gentleman's
Preservation and Success in Life; which we shall acquaint the

<h3>C&nbsp;&nbsp;H&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;P. &nbsp;&nbsp;VII. and
Last.</h3>

<p><i>The true Use of Riches.</i></p>
</center>

<p>The Harmony and Affection that subsisted between this happy
Couple, is inexpressible; but Time, which dissolves the closest
Union, after six Years, severed Sir <i>Charles</i> from his Lady;
for being seized with a violent Fever he died, and left her full of
Grief, tho' possessed of a large Fortune.</p>

<p>We forgot to remark, that after her Marriage, <i>Lady Jones</i>
(for so we must now call her) ordered the Chappel to be fitted up,
and allowed the Chaplain a considerable Sum out of her own private
Purse, to visit the Sick, and say Prayers every Day to all the
People that could attend. <span class="newpage"><a name="page135"
id="page135">[135]</a></span>She also gave Mr. <i>Johnson</i> ten
Guineas a Year, to preach a Sermon, annually, on the Necessity and
Duties of the marriage State, and on the Decease of Sir
<i>Charles</i>; she gave him ten more, to preach yearly on the
Subject of Death; she had put all the Parish into Mourning for the
Loss of her Husband; and to those Men who attended this yearly
Service, she gave Harvest Gloves, to their Wives Shoes and
Stockings, and to all the Children little Books and Plumb-cakes: We
must also observe, that she herself wove a Chaplet of Flowers, and
before the Service, placed it on his Grave-stone; and a suitable
Psalm was always sung by the Congregation.</p>

<p>About this Time, she heard that Mr. <i>Smith</i> was oppressed
by Sir <span class="newpage"><a name="page136" id=
"page136">[136]</a></span>Timothy Gripe, the Justice, and his
Friend <i>Graspall</i>, who endeavoured to deprive him of Part of
his Tythes; upon which she, in Conjunction with her Brother,
defended him, and the Cause was tried in <i>Westminster-hall</i>,
where Mr. <i>Smith</i> gained a Verdict; and it appearing that Sir
<i>Timothy</i> had behaved most scandalously, as a Justice of the
Peace, he was struck off the List, and no longer permitted to act
in that Capacity. This was a Cut to a Man of his imperious
Disposition, and this was followed by one yet more severe; for a
Relation of his, who had an undoubted Right to the <i>Mouldwell</i>
Estate, finding that it was possible to get the better at Law of a
rich Man, laid Claim to it, brought his Action, and recovered the
whole Manor of <i>Mouldwell</i>, and being <span class="newpage"><a
name="page137" id="page137">[137]</a></span>afterwards inclined to
sell it, he, in Consideration of the Aid Lady <i>Margery</i> had
lent him during his Distress, made her the first Offer, and she
purchased the Whole, and threw it into different Farms, that the
Poor might be no longer under the Dominion of two over-grown
Men.</p>

<p>This was a great Mortification to Sir <i>Timothy</i>, as well as
to his Friend <i>Graspall</i>, who from this Time experienced
nothing but Misfortunes, and was in a few Years so dispossessed of
his Ill-gotten Wealth, that his Family were reduced to seek
Subsistance from the Parish, at which those who had felt the Weight
of his Iron Hand rejoiced; but Lady <i>Margery</i> desired, that
his Children might be treated with Care and Tenderness; <i>for
they</i>, says she, <i>are no Ways accountable for the Actions of
their Father</i>.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page138" id=
"page138">[138]</a></span>

<p>At her first coming into Power, she took Care to gratify her old
Friends, especially Mr. and Mrs. <i>Smith</i>, whose Family she
made happy.--She paid great Regard to the Poor, made their Interest
her own, and to induce them to come regularly to Church, she
ordered a Loaf, or the Price of a Loaf, to be given to every one
who would accept of it. This brought many of them to Church, who by
degrees learned their Duty, and then came on a more noble
Principle. She also took Care to encourage Matrimony; and in order
to induce her Tenants and Neighbours to enter into that happy
State, she always gave the young Couple something towards
House-keeping; and stood Godmother to all their Children, whom she
had in Parties, every <i>Sunday</i> Evening, to teach them their
Catechism, and <span class="newpage"><a name="page139" id=
"page139">[139]</a></span>lecture them in Religion and Morality;
after which she treated them with a Supper, gave them such Books as
they wanted, and then dispatched them with her Blessing. Nor did
she forget them at her Death, but left each a Legacy, as will be
seen among other charitable Donations when we publish her Will,
which we may do in some future Volume. There is one Request however
so singular, that we cannot help taking some Notice of it in this
Place; which is, that of her giving so many Acres of Land to be
planted yearly with Potatoes, for all the Poor of any Parish who
would come and fetch them for the Use of their Families; but if any
took them to sell they were deprived of that Privilege ever after.
And these Roots were planted and raised from the Rent arising from
a Farm which she had <span class="newpage"><a name="page140" id=
"page140">[140]</a></span>assigned over for that purpose. In short,
she was a Mother to the Poor, a Physician to the Sick, and a Friend
to all who were in Distress. Her Life was the greatest Blessing,
and her Death the greatest Calamity that ever was felt in the
Neighbourhood. A Monument, but without Inscription, was erected to
her Memory in the Church-yard, over which the Poor as they pass
weep continually, so that the Stone is ever bathed in Tears.</p>

<p>On this Occasion the following Lines were spoken extempore by a
young Gentleman.</p>

<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;How vain the Tears that fall from you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And here supply the Place of Dew?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How vain to weep the happy Dead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who now to heavenly Realms are fled?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Repine no more, your Plaints forbear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all prepare to meet them there.</i></p>

<p>To shew the Depravity of human Nature, and how apt the Mind is
to be misled by Trinkets and false Appearances, Mrs.
<i>Two-Shoes</i> does acknowledge, that after she became rich, she
had like to have been too fond of Money; for on seeing her Husband
receive a very large Sum, her Heart went pit pat, pit pat, all the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page142" id=
"page142">[142]</a></span>Evening, and she began to think that
Guineas were pretty Things. To suppress this Turbulence of Mind,
which was a Symptom of approaching Avarice, she said her Prayers
earlier than usual, and at Night had the following Dream; which I
shall relate in her own Words.</p>

<p>"Methought, as I slept, a Genii stept up to me with a
<i>French</i> Commode, which having placed on my Head, he said, now
go and be happy; for from henceforth every Thing you touch shall
turn to Gold. Willing to try the Experiment, I gently touched the
Bed-post and Furniture, which immediately became massy Gold
burnished, and of surprizing Brightness. I then touched the Walls
of the House, which assumed the same Appearance, and looked
amazingly magnificent. Elated with this wonderful Gift, I rang
hastily for my Maid to carry the joyful News to her Master, who, as
I thought, was then walking in the Garden. <i>Sukey</i> came, but
in the Extacy I was in, happening to touch her Hand, she became
instantly an immovable Statue. <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page143" id="page143">[143]</a></span>Go, said I, and call your
Master; but she made no reply, nor could she stir. Upon this I
shrieked, and in came my dear Husband, whom I ran to embrace; when
no sooner had I touched him, but he became good for nothing; that
is, good for nothing but his Weight in Gold; and that you know
could be nothing, where Gold was so plenty. At this instant up came
another Servant with a Glass of Water, thinking me ill; this I
attempted to swallow, but no sooner did it touch my Mouth, than it
became a hard solid Body, and unfit for drinking. My Distress now
grew insupportable! I had destroyed, as I thought, my dear Husband,
and my favourite Servant; and I plainly perceived, that I should
die for want in the midst of so much Wealth. Ah, said I, why did I
long for Riches! Having enough already, why did I covet more? Thus
terrified, I began to rave, and beat my Breast, which awaked Sir
<i>Charles</i>, who kindly called me from this State of Inquietude,
and composed my Mind."</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page144" id=
"page144">[144]</a></span>

<p>This Scene I have often considered as a Lesson, instructing me,
that a Load of Riches bring, instead of Felicity, a Load of
Troubles; and that the only Source of Happiness is
<i>Contentment</i>. Go, therefore, you who have too much, and give
it to those who are in want; so shall you be happy yourselves, by
making others happy. This is a Precept from the Almighty, a Precept
which must be regarded; for <i>The Lord is about your Paths, and
about your Bed, and spieth out all your Ways</i>.</p>

<br>
<p><i>An Anecdote, respecting</i> T <small>O M</small> T <small>W
O</small>-S <small>H O E S</small>, <i>communicated by a Gentleman,
who is now writing the History of his Life.</i></p>

<p>It is generally known, that <i>Tom Two-Shoes</i> went to Sea
when he was a very little Boy, and very poor; and that he returned
a very great Man, and very rich; but no one knows how he acquired
so much Wealth but myself, and a few <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page145" id="page145">[145]</a></span>Friends, who have perused
the Papers from which I am compiling the History of his Life.</p>

<p>After <i>Tom</i> had been at Sea some Years, he was
unfortunately cast away, on that Part of the Coast of <i>Africa</i>
inhabited by the <i>Hottentots</i>. Here he met with a strange
Book, which the <i>Hottentots</i> did not understand, and which
gave him some Account of <i>Prester John's</i> Country; and being a
Lad of great Curiosity and Resolution he determined to see it;
accordingly he set out on the Pursuit, attended by a young Lion,
which he had tamed and made so fond of him, that he followed him
like a Dog, and obeyed all his Commands; and indeed it was happy
for him that he had such a Companion; for as his Road lay through
large Woods and Forests, that were full of wild Beasts and without
Inhabitants, he must have been soon starved or torn in Pieces, had
he not been both fed and protected by this noble Animal.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page146" id=
"page146">[146]</a></span>

<center><img src="images/image35.png" width="398" height="294" alt=
"Tom and the Lion" border="0"></center>

<p><i>Tom</i> had provided himself with two Guns, a Sword, and as
much Powder and Ball as he could carry; with these Arms, and such a
Companion, it was mighty easy for him to get Food; for the Animals
in these wild and extensive Forests, having never seen the Effects
of a Gun, readily ran from the Lion, who hunted on one Side, to
<i>Tom</i>, who hunted on the other, so that they were either
caught by the Lion, or shot by his Master; and it was pleasant
enough, after a <span class="newpage"><a name="page147" id=
"page147">[147]</a></span>hunting Match, and the Meat was dressed,
to see how Cheek by Joul they sat down to Dinner.</p>

<center><img src="images/image36.png" width="390" height="306" alt=
"Statue of a Man" border="0"></center>

<p>When they came info the Land of <i>Utopia</i>, he discovered the
Statue of a Man created on an open Plain, which had this
Inscription on the Pedestal: <i>On</i> May-day <i>in the Morning,
when the Sun rises, I shall have a Head of Gold</i>. As it was now
the latter End of <i>April</i>, he stayed to see this wonderful
Change; and in the mean time, <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page148" id="page148">[148]</a></span>enquiring of a poor Shepherd
what was the Reason of the Statue being erected there, and with
that Inscription, he was informed, that it was set up many Years
ago by an <i>Arabian</i> Philosopher, who travelled all the World
over in Search of a real Friend; that he lived with, and was
extremely fond of a great Man who inhabited the next Mountain; but
that on some Occasion they quarrelled, and the Philosopher, leaving
the Mountain, retired into the Plain, where he erected this Statue
with his own Hands, and soon after died. To this he added, that all
the People for many Leagues round came there every <i>May</i>
Morning, expecting to see the Stone-head turned to Gold.</p>

<p><i>Tom</i> got up very early on the first of <i>May</i> to
behold this amazing Change, and when he came near the Statue he saw
a Number of People, who all ran away from him in the utmost
Consternation, hating never before seen a Lion follow a Man like a
Lap-dog. Being thus left alone, he fixed his Eyes on the Sun, then
rising with <span class="newpage"><a name="page149" id=
"page149">[149]</a></span>resplendent Majesty, and afterwards
turned to the Statue, but could see no Change in the
Stone.--Surely, says he to himself, there is some mystical Meaning
in this! This Inscription must be an &AElig;nigma, the hidden
Meaning of which I will endeavour to find; for a Philosopher would
never expect a Stone to be turned to Gold; accordingly he measured
the Length of the Shadow, which the Statue gave on the Ground by
the Sun shining on it, and marked that particular Part where the
Head fell, then getting a <i>Chopness</i> (a Thing like a Spade)
and digging, he discovered a Copper-chest, full of Gold, with this
Inscription engraved on the Lid of&nbsp;it.</p>

<center>

</center>

<p>This Lesson, coming as it were from the Dead, struck him with
such Awe, and Reverence for Piety and Virtue, that, before he
removed the Treasure, he kneeled down, and earnestly and fervently
prayed that he might make a prudent, just and proper Use of it. He
then conveyed the Chest away; but how he got it to <i>England</i>,
the Reader <span class="newpage"><a name="page151" id=
"page151">[151]</a></span>will be informed in the History of his
Life. It may not be improper, however, in this Place, to give the
Reader some Account of the Philosopher who hid this Treasure, and
took so much Pains to find a true and real Friend to enjoy it. As
<i>Tom</i> had Reason to venerate his Memory, he was very
particular in his Enquiry, and had this Character of him;--that he
was a Man well acquainted with Nature and with Trade; that he was
pious, friendly, and of a sweet and affable Disposition. That he
had acquired a Fortune by Commerce, and having no Relations to
leave it to, he travelled through <i>Arabia, Persia, India,
Libia</i> and <i>Utopia</i> in search of a real Friend. In this
Pursuit he found several with whom he exchanged good Offices, and
that were polite and obliging, but they often flew off for Trifles;
or as soon as he pretended to be in Distress, and requested their
Assistance, left him to struggle with his own Difficulties. So true
is that Copy in our Books, which says, <i>Adversity is the
Touchstone of Friendship</i>. At last, however, he <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page152" id="page152">[152]</a></span>met with
the <i>Utopian</i> Philosopher, or the wise Man of the Mountain, as
he is called, and thought in him he had found the Friend he wanted;
for though he often pretended to be in Distress, and abandoned to
the Frowns of Fortune, this Man always relieved him, and with such
Chearfulness and Sincerity, that concluding he had found out the
only Man to whom he ought to open both his Purse and his Heart, he
let him so far into his Secrets, as to desire his Assistance in
hiding a large Sum of Money, which he wanted to conceal, lest the
Prince of the Country, who was absolute, should, by the Advice of
his wicked Minister, put him to Death for his Gold. The two
Philosophers met and hid the Money, which the Stranger, after some
Days, went to see, but found it gone. How was he struck to the
Heart, when he found that his Friend, whom he had often tried, and
who had relieved him in his Distress, could not withstand this
Temptation, but broke through the sacred Bonds of Friendship, and
turned even <span class="newpage"><a name="page153" id=
"page153">[153]</a></span>a Thief for Gold which he did not want,
as he was already very rich. Oh! said he, what is the Heart of Man
made of? Why am I condemned to live among People who have no
Sincerity, and who barter the most sacred Ties of Friendship and
Humanity for the Dirt that we tread on? Had I lost my Gold and
found a real Friend, I should have been happy with the Exchange,
but now I am most miserable. After some Time he wiped off his
Tears, and being determined not to be so imposed on, he had
Recourse to Cunning and the Arts of Life. He went to his pretended
Friend with a chearful Countenance, told him he had more Gold to
hide, and desired him to appoint a Time when they might go
together, and open the Earth to put it into the same Pot; the
other, in Hopes of getting more Wealth, appointed the next Evening.
They went together, opened the Ground, and found the Money they had
first placed there, for the artful Wretch, he so much confided in,
had conveyed it again into the Pot, in order to obtain more. <span
class="newpage"><a name="page154" id="page154">[154]</a></span>Our
Philosopher immediately took the Gold, and putting it into his
Pocket, told the other he had now altered his Mind, and should bury
it no more, till he found a Man more worthy of his Confidence. See
what People lose by being dishonest. This calls to my Mind the
Words of the Poet:</p>

<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;A Wit's a Feather, and a Chief's a Rod,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An honest Man's the noblest Work of God.</i></p>

<p>Remember this Story, and take Care whom you trust; but don't be
covetous, sordid and miserable; for the Gold we have is but lent us
to do Good with. We received all from the Hand of God, and every
Person in Distress hath a just Title to a Portion of it.</p>

<p>The Foresight and Sagacity of Mrs. <i>Margery</i> 's Dog calls
to my Mind a Circumstance, which happened when I was a Boy. Some
Gentlemen in the Place where I lived had been hunting, and were got
under a great Tree to shelter themselves from a Thunder Storm; when
a Dog that always followed one of the Gentlemen leaped up his Horse
several Times, and then ran away and barked. At last, the Gentlemen
all followed to see what he would be at; and they were no sooner
gone from the Tree, but it was shivered in Pieces by Lightning!
'Tis remarkable, that as soon as they came from the Tree the Dog
appeared to be very well satisfied, and barked no more. The
Gentleman after this always regarded the Dog as his Friend, treated
him in his Old <span class="newpage"><a name="page156" id=
"page156">[156]</a></span>Age with great Tenderness, and fed him
with Milk as long as he lived.</p>

<p>My old Master <i>Grierson</i> had also a Dog, that ought to be
mentioned with Regard; for he used to set him up as a Pattern of
Sagacity and Prudence, not only to his Journeymen, but to the whole
Neighbours. This Dog had been taught a thousand Tricks, and among
other Feats he could dance, tumble, and drink Wine and Punch till
he was little better than mad. It happened one Day, when the Men
had made him drunk with Liquor, and he was capering about, that he
fell into a large Vessel of boiling Water. They soon got him out,
and he recovered; but he was very much hurt, and being sensible,
that this Accident arose from his losing his Senses by Drinking, he
would never taste any strong Liquor afterwards.--My old Master, on
relating this Story, and shewing the Dog, used to address us thus,
<i>Ah, my Friends, had you but half the Sense of this poor Dog
here, you would never get fuddled, and be Fools.</i></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
